\markboth{Introduction}{Introduction}

Mechanics can be broadly categorized in three parts, of which this text
covers one. \textbf{Statics} explores the effects of \emph{external
loads} applied to \emph{rigid bodies} in \emph{equilibrium}.
\textbf{Dynamics} explores the effects of \emph{external loads} applied
to \emph{rigid bodies} that are not in \emph{equilibrium.} In
\textbf{\emph{Mechanics of Deformable Bodies}}, the subject of this
text, we explore the effects of both \emph{external} and \emph{internal
loads} on \emph{non-rigid bodies} in \emph{equilibrium}.

Since bodies in this text are in equilibrium, many of the principles
from statics still apply. However, because these bodies are non-rigid, a
much deeper analysis is required. Objects in this text will deform. When
loads are applied, they will change their shapes. They will elongate and
bend and twist and, if we're not careful, may even break. Real objects
are deformable, and engineers must take great care to ensure that their
designs do not break or deform so much that they are unfit for purpose.

Have you ever wondered why civil engineers tend to use certain materials
for bridges and buildings, while automotive engineers use an entirely
different set of materials in cars? Meanwhile, aerospace engineers don't
make rockets out of the same materials that biomedical engineers use for
prosthetics. There are many material properties that determine
applications that a given material may, or may not, be suitable for. Two
fundamental concepts explored in this text are stress, which helps us
determine whether an object will break under a given load, and strain,
which relates to the object's deformation.

This text begins with an overview of stress and strain. Depending on how
external loads are applied, there are a variety of potential internal
loads on our object. You are likely already familiar with these loads
and their effects, even if you haven't explicitly though about them.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Axial forces} push or pull on a body. They cause elongation
  and compression. For example, imagine pulling on the ends of an
  elastic band. The band will stretch significantly. Objects may be
  pulled apart or crushed by this load. Imagine doing the same with a
  piece of chalk. There will be a small amount of deformation and the
  chalk will break.
\item
  \textbf{Bending moments} act to bend an object. Imagine propping a
  long piece of plywood up on two supports and standing in the middle.
  The wood will bend. If you jump and land hard enough, it may even
  break.
\item
  \textbf{Shear forces} are created when one body (or part of a body)
  slides relative to another. They commonly occur in conjunction with
  bending moments.
\item
  \textbf{Torsional moments} act to twist an object. Imagine holding the
  ends of a cable and rotating your wrists so that the cable twists
  around itself along its length. You will see the cable rotate through
  ever larger angles. Twist it too far and it will break.
\end{itemize}

This text will explore the effects of these loads and expand your
understanding of these effects. It aims to describe these effects in a
conceptual way, building on your existing understanding. Once these
effects are understood conceptually, we'll learn how to calculate the
exact amount of deformation and the exact size of the stress created.
We'll learn to make sure that our designs stay within appropriate
limits. There will necessarily be a significant amount of math involved
in these calculations but it is just as important, if not more so, that
we understand the principles behind those calculations. As such, this
text leads with conceptual descriptions and realistic examples before
working numerical problems.

The stress and strain resulting from these four types of load account
for the majority of this text. Once they are thoroughly understood, more
advanced topics necessary for a thorough understanding of these
fundamental concepts are included. Upon completion of a course using
this text, students will be able to explain the stress and strain
observed under different types of load, calculate the amount of stress
and strain, and design individual components to be within acceptable
limits for both. Students will be prepared for advanced courses in a
variety of engineering disciplines, and will be able to apply their
knowledge to realistic scenarios.

Like in Statics, all bodies and structures discussed in this text will
be assumed to be in static equilibrium. Unlike Statics, which assumed
that all bodies were rigid, bodies in this text are deformable. In order
to determine how an applied loading situation affects any given body or
structure, and potentially causes it to deform, we must start by
applying statics to establish the distribution of forces and moments
within the body. This will be the first step of many problems. This
chapter will present a review of those aspects of statics concepts that
will be prevalent throughout this course.

External forces and moments are the forces and moments that act on the
boundaries of a system. They are the loads that are applied arbitrarily
(weight, wind, pressure, etc.), as well as the reactions they induce in
the supporting elements (pins, rollers, welds, etc.). In the case of
external reactions, the word ``reaction'' refers to the forces and/or
moments exerted by the supports on the body in reaction to the other
loading in order to keep the body in equilibrium.

Finding the external reactions will be the first step of many of the
types of problems that will be covered in this text. This process will
entail first drawing a free body diagram (FBD) of the body, or a sketch
of the body freed from its supports, which shows the applied and
reaction forces and moments. The reactions that correspond to the most
common supports are illustrated below in Table 1.1.

\includegraphics[width=93.75in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/table 1.1 part 4.png} \\
\end{longtable}

Notice that while pins and fixed supports react with a force in a
specific direction, both the magnitude and direction of the force are
unknown until equilibrium equations are applied to solve for them.
Instead of expressing the components of the unknown F in terms of the
unknown θ, the reactions are normally shown as the components
F\textsubscript{x} and F\textsubscript{y}. Once they are found, the
overall magnitude of the force in the pin and its direction can be
calculated
\(\left(F=\sqrt{F_x^2+F_y^2}, \tan \theta_x=\frac{F_y}{F_x}\right)\).

\section{Equilibrium in Two Dimensions}\label{sec-1.1}

Click to expand

Once the FBD is drawn, the next step is to apply the equilibrium
equations. In two dimensions (x-y plane), these are:

\[
\sum F_x=0 \quad \sum F_y=0 \quad \sum M_{\text {any point }}=0
\]

Since there are three equations, a statically determinate problem should
have no more than 3 unknowns.

Example 1.1 illustrates the process of finding external reactions.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 1.1}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A 3 ft beam is supported by a pin connection at the wall at point A and
a cable at point C as shown. A load is applied 2 ft away from point A.
Find the force in pin A as well as the tensile force in the cable.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.75in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.1 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

\textbf{Step 1: Draw the FBD}

Note that a guess needs to be made for the positive or negative sense of
A\textsubscript{x} and A\textsubscript{y}, but the tensile force from a
cable should always be shown to pull away from the body. The correct
sense of A\textsubscript{x} and A\textsubscript{y} will be determined by
obtaining positive or negative answers for the values. A positive answer
means the direction was correctly assumed and a negative answer means
the force should be in the opposite direction.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.64583in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.1 part 2.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Step 2: Apply equilibrium equations}

Starting with the moment about A will eliminate two unknowns from the
equation so that tensile force T can be solved for. Then substitute the
result from T into the other two equations to find A\textsubscript{x}
and A\textsubscript{y}.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sum M_A=T \sin (30^{\circ}) * 3{~ft}-1,200{~lb }*2{~ft}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad T=1,600 {~lb} \\
& \sum F_x=-A_x-T \cos (30^{\circ})=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad A_x=-1,384.6{~lb} \\
& \sum F_y=A_y+T \sin (30^{\circ})-1200{~lb}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad A_y= 400{~lb}
\end{aligned}
\]

Since a negative answer was obtained for A\textsubscript{x}, that force
actually acts in the positive x direction.

The total force in pin A is then \(F_A=\sqrt{A_x^2+A_y^2}=1,441{~lb}\)

\textbf{Answer: T = 1,600 lb, FA = 1,441 lb}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Two Force Members}\label{two-force-members}

One special type of pin connection for which the direction of the
reaction force is known is one in which the pin is connected to a
\textbf{two-force member}. Contrary to the name, a two-force member is
not necessarily a member on which only two forces are applied, but
rather it is a member on which forces are applied at only two locations.
A two-force member can be any shape, as is demonstrated in Figure 1.1.
One easy way to recognize a two-force member is to note the presence of
only two connection points (such as two pins) but no other locations at
which a force or moment couple is applied. Once a member is recognized
to be a two-force member, it can be concluded that the resultant force
at both connection points will be equal in magnitude (so
F\textsubscript{A} = F\textsubscript{B} in Figure 1.1) and opposite in
direction and follow a line of action that goes through the connections.
For a straight member, it can also be concluded that the force within
the two-force member (internal reaction as will be discussed in Section
1.1) is equal to the reaction force in the pin.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=6.6875in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/figure 1.1.png}

}

\caption{Figure 1.1: Illustrations of two force members showing the line
of action of the reaction force passing through the joints. Note that
F\textsubscript{A} = F\textsubscript{B}.}

\end{figure}%

The presence and recognition of two force members can make some
otherwise statically indeterminate problems become statically
determinate. This is demonstrated in Example 1.2 below.

\textbf{Step 1: Draw the FBD}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5.10417in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.2 part 2.png}
\end{center}

Based on this FBD, it appears that there are 4 unknowns and therefore
not solvable by just 3 equilibrium equations. However, recognizing that
bar AB is a two-force member (since there is a pin at A and a pin at B
but no other forces acting on that bar), it can be taken as known that
the line of action of the reaction force at A goes through points A and
B. Thus, the FBD can be redrawn with just 3 unknowns:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.83333in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.2 part 3.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Step 2: Apply equilibrium equations}

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{(1)}& \sum M_C=-F_A \cos \left(60^{\circ}\right)*(3{~m}) \sin \left(60^{\circ}\right)+F_A \sin \left(60^{\circ}\right) *\left(4{~m}+3{~m}\left(\cos \left(60^{\circ}\right)\right)-2,000{~ N}*2{~m}=0\right. \\
\text{(2)}& \sum F_x=F_A \cos \left(60^{\circ}\right)+C_x=0 \\
\text{(3)}& \sum F_y=F_A \sin \left(60^{\circ}\right)-2,000{~N}+C_y=0
\end{aligned}
\]

Solving (1) for F\textsubscript{A} yields F\textsubscript{A} = 1,154.7 N

Subbing this result into (1) and (2) yields C\textsubscript{x} = -577.4
N and C\textsubscript{y} = 1,000 N

\[
F_C=\sqrt{C_x^2+C_y^2}=1,154.7{~N}
\]

\textbf{Answer: F\textsubscript{A} = 1,155 N and F\textsubscript{C} =
1,155 N}

\section{Internal Reactions}\label{sec-1.2}

Click to expand

Internal reactions can refer to forces and moments at connection points
between members (such as a pin connecting multiple members of a frame,
machine, or truss), as well as to reactions at any point in a continuous
body (for example a point in the middle of a beam). These reactions are
the forces and/or moments necessary to hold a structure or a body
together and are ultimately the aspect of loading that is needed to
determine if and how a body will deform or even break.

\subsection{Internal reactions at a connection with two force
members}\label{internal-reactions-at-a-connection-with-two-force-members}

Pins that connect members can be represented on an FBD in the same way
as pins that connect the structure to external supports. That is, the
reaction would be drawn as the two components of the overall force.
However, the connected members would be considered as separate bodies,
as if the connecting pin were pulled out and the members separated. The
pin reactions would then be drawn on the FBD for each separated member.
Since the pin would exert equal and opposite forces on the connected
members, one needs to be careful to show the reaction forces in opposite
directions on the FBD's of those members. All three equilibrium
equations can be applied separately to each member so one could
theoretically solve for 3 times the number of unknowns as separate FBD's
drawn.

However, just as was discussed above, when one of the connected members
is a two-force member, the reaction at the pin will be known to follow a
line of action that goes through the points of application of the forces
on the two-force member. Example 1.3 demonstrates these concepts.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 1.3}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A plant hanger is secured to a wall with a pin and additionally
supported by a brace that is pin connected to the hanger at B and to the
wall at C. Determine the external reactions at A and C as well as the
reaction in the internal pin B.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.28125in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.3 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

If we do not notice that BC is a two-force member, we would approach the
problem by separating the brace from the hanger and drawing an FBD of
each part separately. Notice that B\textsubscript{x} and
B\textsubscript{y} are drawn in opposite directions in the two different
diagrams since the pin will exert an equal and opposite force on each
bar.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5.86458in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.3 part 2.png}
\end{center}

There are now 6 unknowns and 6 equilibrium equations (3 equations per
body) available to use per bar, so the problem is technically solvable.
However, since BC is a two force member (there is a pin force at B and a
pin force at C but no other forces at any other point on the bar), it
can be taken as known that the reaction force at B follows a line of
action that goes through B and C. We can also conclude that the force in
pin C is equal to the force in pin B. The FBD of bar AB can be redrawn:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.1875in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.3 part 3.png}
\end{center}

With the components B\textsubscript{x} and B\textsubscript{y} replaced
with the resultant force F\textsubscript{B} with known direction, the
number of unknowns on bar AB is reduced to 3. These unknowns can be
solved for using the equilibrium equations:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{(1)} & \sum M_A=F_B\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)*3{~ft}-50{~lb}*7{~ft}=0 \\
\text{(2)} & \sum F_x=-A_x+F_B\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)=0 \\
\text{(3)} & \sum F_y=A_y+F_B\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)-50{~lb}=0
\end{aligned}
\]

Solving the equations (1)-(3) yields F\textsubscript{B} = 145.8 lb,
A\textsubscript{x} = 87.5 lb, and A\textsubscript{y} = -66.7 lb.
Therefore, the pin force in pin B is 145.8 lb and the pin force in A is
\(\mathrm{A}=\sqrt{A_x^2+A_y^2}=110 \text{ lb}\). Since BC is a
two-force member, F\textsubscript{C} = F\textsubscript{B}.

\textbf{Answer: F\textsubscript{A} = 110 lb, F\textsubscript{B} =
F\textsubscript{C} = 146.8 lb}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Internal reactions in truss
structures}\label{internal-reactions-in-truss-structures}

Truss structures are made up of only two force members. The two main
methods of determining internal reactions in planar (2D) truss
structures are Method of Joints and Method of Sections. In using Method
of Joints, an FBD is drawn of the connecting pins (joints) within the
truss. Since all the members connected at any given pin will be
two-force members, the reactions can be drawn in known directions.
However, since the forces all pass through the same point on the body,
the moment equilibrium equation is not useful, so only the forces
equilibrium equations can be used for each joint. This means that only
two unknowns can be solved for at each joint. This method is most useful
when the forces of all the truss members are sought or if the only
forces sought are attached to a joint with only two members.

To use Method of Sections, a cut is made through the truss structure and
analysis is based on the FBD of the intact part of the structure that is
to the left of the cut or the intact part of the structure to the right
of the cut. The FBD of either given side will show the applied forces
and the reaction forces from the members that were cut through. These
reactions will be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction between
the two sides of the cut. The side to examine is usually based on which
one will not require having to find external reactions (if there is a
free end to the truss) and/or which one is least complicated to deal
with in terms of geometry or applied loads. All three equilibrium
equations can generally be effectively applied with Method of Sections,
so three unknowns can be solved for with any given cut.

Example 1.4 demonstrates the use of both Method of Joints and Method of
Sections to solve for forces in truss members.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 1.4}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Determine the forces in members ED and EF. Let P\textsubscript{1} = 8 kN
and P\textsubscript{2} = 12 kN.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.4 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution - Method of Joints}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Considering Joint E, it can be seen that since there are 4 members
attached to the joint, there would be 4 unknown forces to account for.
Therefore, starting with Method of Joints at E would not work. However,
looking at joint D, there are only two unknowns, with one of them being
member ED, so that would be a useful place to start.

\textbf{FBD Joint D}

Note: The triangle ECD is a right triangle, so the sin and cos of the
angle at corner D can be expressed in terms of the ratios of the sides.
If the angle at D is θ, then cos(θ)= \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\) and sin(θ)=
\(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\) where \(\sqrt{5}\) is the hypotenuse of the
triangle.

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{(1)} & \sum F_x=-F_{C D}-F_{D E}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right)=0 \\
\text{(2)} & \sum F_y=F_{D E}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right)-12{~kN}=0
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.3125in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.4 part 2.png}
\end{center}

Solving (1) and (2) gives F\textsubscript{DE} = 13.42 kN (tensile) and
F\textsubscript{DC} = -6 kN.

Since the force is shown to be tensile in the FBD (the force is pointed
away from the joint), the negative answer indicates the force is
actually compressive.

Even with knowing F\textsubscript{DE}, joint E would have three unknown
forces. Joint C only has two unknown forces, so we can draw that joint
next. Note that we previously determined F\textsubscript{CD} = 6 kN in
compression, so we will draw that force in compression at joint C.
Forces F\textsubscript{BC} and F\textsubscript{CE} are unknown and may
be drawn in either direction. For this example they've been drawn in
tension.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5.34375in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.4 part 3.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sum F_x=-F_{B C}-6=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad F_{B C}=-6{~kN}\\
&\sum F_y=F_{C E}=0
\end{aligned}
\]

Then at joint E:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.84375in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.4 part 4.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sum F_y=-13.42{~kN}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right)-F_{B E}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{8}}\right)=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad F_{B C}=-16.98{~kN}\\
&\sum F_x=13.42{~kN}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right)--16.98{~kN}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{8}}\right)-F_{E F}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad F_{E F}=18\text{ kN}
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{Answer: F\textsubscript{DC} = 6 kN (Compressive),
F\textsubscript{EF} = 18 kN (Tensile)}

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution - Method of Sections}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

While Method of Joints can be used here, it is inefficient. We needed to
draw and analyze free body diagrams of joints D, C, and E and keep track
of the forces at these joints as well as whether each force was in
tension or compression.

Method of Sections may be used as an alternative to find force FEF. To
apply Method of Sections for this problem, a cut will be made through
the truss that passes vertically through members EF, BE, and BC. Once
that cut is made, a choice needs to be made to draw an FBD for the
intact part of the truss to the left of the cut (everything to the left
of BF in this case) or the intact part of the truss to the right of the
cut (everything to the right of EC in this case). Either way, the
external forces on the side would need to be shown on the FBD as well as
the force of each member that was cut through. This is illustrated
below. Notice that the forces are drawn in opposite directions on the
different sides of the cut.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.4 part 5.png}
\end{center}

Looking at the FBD of the two cut sections, the right side section would
be easiest to work with since there are no external reactions on that
side. If the left side section were picked, the reactions at A and G
would first need to be determined (note that FGF = Gx). All three
equilibrium equations can be used with the Method of Sections. In this
particular case in which only EEF is left to solve for, only the moment
about B is needed to solve since the other two unknown forces both pass
through B.

\[
\sum M_B=-P_2*3{~m}+F_{E F}*2{~m}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad F_{E F}=18{~kN}
\]

Once again, the forces are drawn on the FBD in the tensile direction, so
the negative answer indicates a compressive force.

\textbf{Answer: F\textsubscript{DC} = 6 kN (Compressive),
F\textsubscript{EF} = 18 kN (Tensile)}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Internal reactions in continuous
bodies}\label{internal-reactions-in-continuous-bodies}

Internal reactions also exist within a body or structure. These
reactions are necessary to hold the body together and will vary from
point to point in a body depending on the distribution of external
loading. As shown in Figure 1.2, the reactions at any given point can be
examined by making a cut at the point of interest in the body. One can
think of any point within a body as acting as a fixed support for the
rest of the body. That is, every point must potentially exert a force
parallel to the cross section where the cut is made which is the shear
force V, a force perpendicular to the cross section where the cut is
made which is the normal force N, and a reaction moment where the cut is
made which is the bending moment M. Moreover, as was discussed for
internal pin reactions and the cut made for Method of Sections for
trusses, the reactions at a cut will be equal and opposite on the two
sides of the cut.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.03125in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/figure 1.2.png}

}

\caption{Figure 1.2: Cross-sections showing the internal loads on a
continuous body}

\end{figure}%

To determine the reactions, the FBD of the part of the beam to the left
of the cut can be drawn and used, or the part of the beam to the right
of the cut can be drawn and used. As was discussed with Method of
Sections for trusses, the choice of which side of the cut to examine is
based primarily on which side appears easiest and most efficient to
analyze. Once the FBD of the cut section is drawn, the three equilibrium
equations can be applied to determine the internal reactions. The
determination of shear and bending moments in beams will be reviewed in
more detail in Chapter~\ref{sec-beams}. The focus of Example 1.5 is on
the determination of the normal force, as this will be important in
Chapter~\ref{sec-stress} and Chapter~\ref{sec-strain}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 1.5}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Two solid bars make up the axial assembly loaded as shown. Determine the
normal force in each bar. State whether the force is tensile or
compressive.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.16667in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.5 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Though the assembly is not a beam, determining the internal reactions
will work in the same way. In this particular case, all the forces are
in the normal direction (no shear force) and due to the central
placement of the 60 kN force and the symmetry of the 125 kN forces,
there will be also be no bending moment. Consequently, only the normal
reaction force will be drawn on the FBDs.

You may recall from shear and moment analysis of beams, a cut is made
whenever there is a loading change. In this example, there is a loading
change at B, so there will be two sections of the assembly with distinct
normal reactions.

Making the cut in section AB and drawing the FBD allows us to determine
the normal force in section AB. Note that drawing the left section of
the cut for the FBD results in avoiding needing to know the external
reactions at wall C.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.5 part 2.png}
\end{center}

\[
\sum F_x=-60{~kN}+N_{A B}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad N_{A B}=60{~kN}
\]

Making the cut in section BC and drawing the FBD allows us to determine
the normal force in section BC. Once again, drawing the left section of
the cut for the FBD results in avoiding needing to know the external
reactions at wall C.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.5625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.5 part 3.png}
\end{center}

\[
\sum F_x=-60{~kN}+250{~kN}+N_{BC}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad N_{BC}=-190{~kN}
\]

For both AB and BC, the internal normal force was assumed tensile in the
FBD and equilibrium equation. In the case of NAB, the positive answer
confirms that it is tensile. In the case of NBC, the negative answer
reveals that it is compressive.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.34375in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.5 part 4.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Answer: NAB = 60 kN (T), NBC = 190 kN (C)}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Equilibrium and Reactions in Three Dimensions}\label{sec-1.3}

Click to expand

Because real life structures will be subject to forces and moments in
all directions, we will also see problems in which it will be necessary
to consider 3 dimensional forces and 3 dimensional moments.

For 3D systems, there are 6 total scalar equilibrium equations:

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\sum F_x=0 & \sum M_x=0 \\
\sum F_y=0 & \sum M_y=0 \\
\sum F_z=0 & \sum M_z=0
\end{array}
\]

Note that the moment vector describes the axis around which the body
tends to rotate. Each individual component represents the tendency of
the body to rotate around the specified axis. In 3D, there are three
internal forces and three internal moments (Figure 1.3). There is one
normal force (N\textsubscript{x}) perpendicular to the cross-section and
two shear forces (V\textsubscript{y} and V\textsubscript{z}) parallel to
the cross-section. There are two bending moments (M\textsubscript{y} and
M\textsubscript{z}) which act around the axes parallel to the
cross-section and one torsional moment (T\textsubscript{x}) which acts
around the axis perpendicular to the cross-section. We will study each
of these loads in detail over the next few chapters.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.3125in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/figure 1.3.png}

}

\caption{Figure 1.3: In 3D there are three internal forces (normal force
N\textsubscript{x} and two shear forces V\textsubscript{y} and
V\textsubscript{z}) and three internal moments (torsional moment
T\textsubscript{x} and two bending moments M\textsubscript{y} and
M\textsubscript{z})}

\end{figure}%

Note that the choice of coordinate system here is arbitrary. Loads are
defined as normal, shear, bending, or torsion based on how they act
relative to the cross-section. For example, the normal force may act in
the y-direction depending on how the cross-section is cut, and the
torsional moment would then act around the y-axis.

While summing the reaction forces in 3D is a straight-forward process of
adding forces in each direction, summing moments in 3D can prove to be
more complicated. To sum moments, there are generally two options. One
option is to use the cross product to calculate moments:
\(M=r \times F\)

In the cross-product equation, \textbf{r} is the position vector from
the point the moment is about to any point on the line of action of the
force. Using the cross product to calculate moment will result in a
vector expression for the moment equation that gives all three
components at one time with the correct signs to indicate clockwise
(negative) or counterclockwise (positive) rotation.

The second option to calculate moments is to perform scalar calculations
in which the sum of the moments about the x, y, and z axis is calculated
individually. To use this option, it might be helpful to recall:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The general scalar equation for moment is M = F*d, where d is the
  perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation at the point the
  moment is being taken about to anywhere on the line of action of the
  force. One can also use M = F r sin α where r is the distance from the
  point to any point on the force and α is the angle between the
  position vector \textbf{r} (that corresponds to the magnitude r used)
  and the force vector.
\item
  Forces do not cause moments about points they go through or axes they
  act through.
\item
  Forces do not cause moments about axes they are parallel to (i.e.,
  F\textsubscript{x} wouldn't cause a moment around an x-axis no matter
  where the point is).
\item
  When taking the moment about a point, the origin of the coordinate
  axes should be moved to that point for the purpose of determining the
  distance between the axis and the force.
\end{enumerate}

Given all the reminders above, one can apply the following equations:

\(\sum M_x= \pm F_y * z \pm F_z * y\) where z and y are the respective
distances from the x-axis at the point in question to F\textsubscript{y}
and F\textsubscript{z} components of the force respectively.

\(\sum M_y= \pm F_x * z \pm F_z * x\) where z and x are the respective
distances from the y-axis at the point in question to F\textsubscript{x}
and F\textsubscript{z} components of the force respectively.

\(\sum M_z= \pm F_x * y \pm F_y * x\) where y and x are the respective
distances from the z-axis at the point in question to the
F\textsubscript{x} and F\textsubscript{y} components of the force
respectively.

The ± is decided based on the right-hand rule (see text below for
guidance) or visual inspection. When using visual inspection, the
direction of rotation is judged by looking from the positive end of the
axis towards the negative end. A counterclockwise rotation is considered
to be positive and a clockwise rotation is considered to be negative.

To apply the right-hand rule:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Orient your right hand so that the fingers are aligned with the moment
  arm with the palm at the point and the fingertips extending towards
  the force. The moment arm is the axis along which the perpendicular
  distance to the axis would be determined. For example, if finding
  M\textsubscript{x} due to F\textsubscript{y}, the moment arm is in the
  z direction.
\item
  The thumb is aligned with the axis of rotation (axis around which the
  moment is being calculated).
\item
  Curl your fingers in the direction of the force. If your thumb must be
  pointed in the positive axis direction to perform this action, the
  moment is counterclockwise. If your thumb must be pointed in the
  negative axis direction, the moment is clockwise. Typical convention
  designates counterclockwise rotation to be positive and clockwise to
  be negative.
\end{enumerate}

These concepts are further reviewed in Example 1.6.

Determine the internal reactions at point P, located at the center of

To determine the internal reactions at P, a cut is made at P that is
parallel to the cross section. Since the left side of the cut would
include the wall but the right side of the cut would be free with no
external reactions to determine, the right side section will be used.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.04167in,height=\textheight]{images/CH1 PNGs/example 1.6 part 2.png}
\end{center}

The force reactions at P will just be equal (but opposite in direction)
to the force shown since there is only one. The moment reactions can be
found by taking the moments about point P.

The moment about the x axis at point P is:

\[
\sum M_{Px} = \pm ~F_yz \pm F_zy = 0 = -[(225{~lb})(3{~in})(\frac{1{~ft}}{12{~in}})]+[(300{~lb})(2{~in})(\frac{1{~ft}}{12{~in}})]+M_{px} -6.25{~lb·ft}
\]

The moment about the y axis at point P is:

\[
\sum M_{Py} = \pm ~F_xz \pm F_zx = 0 = -[(150{~lb})(3{~in})(\frac{1{~ft}}{12{~in}})]-[(300{~lb})(1.25{~ft})]+M_{py} -347.5{~lb·ft}
\]

The moment about the z axis at point P is:

\[
\sum M_{Pz} = \pm F_xy \pm F_yx = 0 = [(150{~lb})(2{~in})(\frac{1{~ft}}{12{~in}})]-[(225{~lb})(1.25{~ft})]+M_{pz} -2.5{~lb·ft}
\]

The sign on the individual multiplicative terms in each equation are
determined by right hand rule or visualization.

\textbf{Answer:}

P\textsubscript{x} = 150 lb

P\textsubscript{y} = 225 lb

P\textsubscript{z} = 300 lb

M\textsubscript{Px} = 6.25 lb·ft

M\textsubscript{Py} = 348 lb·ft

M\textsubscript{Pz} = 2.5 lb·ft

Bodies in this text are in static equilibrium and subjected to external
forces and moments. Reaction forces and moments at supports can be
determined in 2D and 3D through equilibrium equations, just like in
Statics.

Unlike Statics, bodies in this course are deformable. We must also
determine internal loads. These can be found by cutting a cross-section
at the point of interest and again applying equilibrium equations.

In 2D there are two internal forces and one internal moment:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Normal force (N) perpendicular to the cross-section
\item
  Shear force (V) parallel to the cross-section
\item
  Bending moment (M)
\end{itemize}

In 3D there are three internal forces and three internal moments:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Normal force (N) perpendicular to the cross-section
\item
  Two shear forces (V) parallel to the cross-section
\item
  Torsional moment (T) acting around the axis perpendicular to the
  cross-section
\item
  Two bending moments (M) acting around the axes parallel to the
  cross-section
\end{itemize}

The effects of these internal loads on deformable bodies is the focus of
this text.

\markright{Introduction}

Click to expand

Having reviewed static equilibrium in Chapter~\ref{sec-statics}, we now
know how to find the internal loads in a body using equilibrium. When
determining whether a body can resist the loads applied to it, the
internal load is only part of the solution. The dimensions of the body
and the inherent properties of the material it is made from are also
important.

In this chapter we'll explore the concept of stress, which can help us
determine whether an object will physically break when subjected to a
load. We'll cover average normal stress (stress perpendicular to the
cross-section) in Section 2.1 and average shear stress (stress parallel
to the cross-section) in Section 2.2. We'll then discuss bearing stress
(the stress between two bodies in contact with each other) in Section
2.3 and finish with the average normal and shear stresses on an inclined
cross-section in Section 2.4.

\section{Average Normal Stress}\label{sec-2.1}

Click to expand

Average normal stress is defined as the internal normal force divided by
the cross-sectional area of the body. It is given the Greek letter sigma
(σ). Stress increases as the force increases or as the cross-sectional
area decreases.

\[
\sigma=\frac{N}{A}
\]

\emph{where}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  𝜎 = Average normal stress {[}Pa, psi{]}
\item
  N = Internal normal force {[}N, lb{]}
\item
  A = Cross-sectional area {[}m\textsuperscript{2},
  in\textsuperscript{2}{]}
\end{itemize}

As such the SI units of stress are N/m\textsuperscript{2}, more commonly
referred to as the Pascal (Pa) where 1 Pa = 1 N/m\textsuperscript{2}.
The US customary units for stress are lb/in\textsuperscript{2}, commonly
written as psi. Since stresses can get very large, it is common to use
prefixes such as kilo (k) and mega (M) to represent
10\textsuperscript{3} and 10\textsuperscript{6} respectively. A stress
of 15,000,000 Pa is written as 15 MPa. A stress of 35,000 psi is written
as 35 ksi.

Normal stress occurs perpendicular to the cross-section and so is
associated with either a pulling or pushing motion (Figure 2.1). Normal
forces that pull on a cross-section are known as tensile forces and
create a tensile normal stress. Normal forces that push on a
cross-section are known as compressive forces and create a compressive
normal stress. The normal stress calculated above is really an average
normal stress as the force is distributed over the cross-section, but we
generally simplify this to a concentrated force that creates the same
normal stress at every point on the cross-section (Figure 2.2).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH2 figures/2.1.png}

}

\caption{Figure 2.1: Forces pulling on a cross-section cause tension,
while forces pushing on a cross-section cause compression. Both are very
common. Left: A crane cable during a lift experiences tension. Right:
The support columns under a bridge experience compression.}

\end{figure}%%
\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH2 figures/2.2.png}

}

\caption{Figure 2.2: The internal load is equally distributed over the
cross-sectional area, but may be represented as a single concentrated
load acting at the center (N in this case). The stress is therefore an
average normal stress.}

\end{figure}%

The internal normal force in a body can be found through the method of
equilibrium as reviewed in Section~\ref{sec-1.2}. See Example 2.1 for a
demonstration.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 2.1}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The support column will be subjected to a compressive force F = 65 kips.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.14583in,height=\textheight]{images/CH2 figures/example 2.1 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The diameter of the column is 4 inches. Determine the average normal
  stress in the column.
\item
  The column is to be made of concrete with an allowable compressive
  stress of 4 ksi. For the same force F = 65 kips, determine the
  required diameter of the column so that the average normal stress does
  not exceed 4 ksi.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Cut a cross-section through the column and draw a free body diagram.
  Although it is clear in this case that the internal load will be 65
  kips, it is best to get in the habit of writing out equilibrium
  equations.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.73958in,height=\textheight]{images/CH2 figures/example 2.1 part 2.png}
\end{center}

\[
\sum F_y= N-65{~kips}=0
\]

The column has a circular cross-section of area
\(A=\pi(2)^2=4 \pi{~in.}^2\).

The average normal stress can now be found from:

\[
\sigma=\frac{N}{A}=\frac{65{~kips}}{4 \pi{~in.}^2}=5.17{~ksi}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Use the average normal stress equation again, but this time the stress
  is known to be 4 ksi. The loading has not changed so the internal
  normal force will still be 65 kips.
\end{enumerate}

\[
\sigma=\frac{N}{A} \rightarrow A=\frac{N}{\sigma}=\frac{65{~kips}}{4{~ksi}}=16.25 {~in}^2
\]

Since \(A=\pi r^2\) we can find
\(r=\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}=\sqrt{\frac{16.25{~in.}^2}{\pi}}=2.27{~in}\).

Then \(d=2 r=2 * 2.27{~in.}=4.55{~in.}\)

Note that this is the minimum required diameter to ensure the average
normal stress does not exceed 4 ksi. If the diameter is any smaller than
this, the stress will exceed the 4 ksi limit.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

Sometimes the loading or cross-sectional area of the body will change,
resulting in a change in stress. In these cases the stress can be
calculated separately in each segment of the body by first finding the
internal load in each segment and then dividing the internal load by the
cross-sectional area of the respective segment. Different parts of the
body may experience different stresses. Generally the highest stress is
of most importance as that is the stress that typically determines
whether the body will break. Because we do not know in advance where the
largest stress is, however, it is typically necessary to calculate the
stress at each different cross-section in order to determine the highest
stress. See Example 2.2 for a demonstration.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 2.2}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Two hollow pipes are welded together as shown. Pipe (1) has an outer
diameter of 70 mm and an inner diameter of 40 mm while pipe (2) has an
outer diameter of 110 mm and an inner diameter of 60 mm. Forces are
applied at the end of each pipe and at the weld, where F1 = 40 kN, F2 =
70 kN, and F3 = 30 kN. Determine the average normal stress in each pipe.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

We can calculate average normal stress using \(\sigma=\frac{N}{A}\) so
we will need to find the area of each pipe and the normal force in each
pipe. This can be done in any order. Starting with the areas:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& A_1=\pi\left(0.035^2-0.02^2\right)=0.00259{~m}^2 \\
& A_2=\pi\left(0.055^2-0.03^2\right)=0.00668{~m}^2
\end{aligned}
\]

The internal loads can be found by cutting a cross-section through each
pipe, drawing a free body diagram, and writing an equilibrium equation.

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sum F_x=40{~kN}-N_1=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad N_1=40{~kN} \\
&\sum F_x=40{~kN}-70{~kN}+N_2=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad N_2=30{~kN}
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that we may choose to draw the internal load in either tension or
compression. The answer must be compared to the free body diagram. A
positive answer from the equilibrium equation indicates that the
direction drawn on the free body diagram was correct. Although both
answers here were positive, it can be seen in the free body diagrams
that N\textsubscript{1} was drawn in compression and N\textsubscript{2}
was drawn in tension. These positive answers indicate that the drawings
are correct. N\textsubscript{1} is 40 kN in compression and
N\textsubscript{2} is 30 kN in tension.

Note also that it is acceptable to draw a free body diagram of either
side of the cross-section. This will not change the result. Perhaps it
would have been easier to draw the right-hand-side of section 2.

\[
\sum F_x=30{~kN}+N_2=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad N_2=30{~kN}
\]

We again find that N\textsubscript{2} is 30 kN in tension. You may
always choose to draw either side of a cross-section. Make sure to
include everything to that side of your cut, all the way to the end of
the structure (e.g.~do not stop at the weld).

Now that the areas and internal loads are known we can calculate the
internal normal stresses.

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_1=\frac{N_1}{A_1}=\frac{-40,000{~N}}{0.00259{~m}^2}=-15.4{~MPa} \\
\sigma_2=\frac{N_2}{A_2}=\frac{30,000{~N}}{0.00668{~m}^2}=4.49{~MPa}
\end{gathered}
\]

\section{Average Shear Stress}\label{sec-2.2}

Click to expand

Average shear stress is defined as the internal shear force divided by
the cross-sectional area of the body. While normal forces (and therefore
normal stresses) occur when a body is under tension or compression,
shear forces (and therefore shear stresses) occur when a force is
tangentially applied parallel to the cross-section, resulting in a
sliding motion (Figure 2.3).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH2 figures/2.3.png}

}

\caption{Figure 2.3: (a) External loads F creating (b) an internal
normal force (N) perpendicular to the cross-section. (c) External loads
F\textsubscript{1}, F\textsubscript{2}, and F\textsubscript{3} creating
(d) an internal shear force (V) parallel to the cross-section. Note that
for diagram (d) to be in equilibrium there would also need to be an
internal bending moment. That has been omitted here for clarity.}

\end{figure}%

Although the basic definition of average normal stress and average shear
stress is the same (force divided by area) there are some differences.
To quickly differentiate which stress we are talking about, shear stress
is denoted by the Greek letter tau (τ).

\[
\tau=\frac{V}{A}
\]

\,\,\,where \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,

τ = Average shear stress {[}Pa, psi{]} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,

V = Internal sheal force {[}N, lb{]} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,

A = Cross-sectional area {[}m\textsuperscript{2},
in\textsuperscript{2}{]}

Like normal force, internal shear force can be found by cutting a
cross-section through the body, drawing a free body diagram, and
applying equilibrium equations. See Example 2.3 for a demonstration.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 2.3}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A bridge spans a gap of L = 150 ft. The roadway may be considered simply
supported and has a rectangular cross-section of base b = 10 in. and
height h = 6 in. It is subjected to a uniform distributed load of w =
200 lb/ft. Determine the magnitude of the average shear stress in the
cross-section at x = 30 ft and x = 80 ft.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Average shear stress can be calculated from \(\tau=\frac{V}{A}\). The
cross-sectional area is \(A=10{~in.}*6{~in.}=60{~in.}^2\)

The reactions at the support can be found by converting the distributed
load into a statically equivalent concentrated load. This load will be
equal to \(F=200{~lb/ft}*150{~ft}=30000{~lb}\) and will be located at
the center of the bridge. Since the loading is symmetric, each support
will support half of this load, or 15000 lb each.

The internal shear force can be found by cutting a cross-section through
the point of interest, drawing a free body diagram, and applying
equilibrium equations. Remember to include the internal loads V and M,
and to again convert the distributed load into a statically equivalent
concentrated load over this portion of the bridge.

At x = 30 ft:

\[
\sum F_y=15,000{~lb}-6,000{~lb}-V=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad V=9,000{~lb}
\]

Note that an internal bending moment is also necessary in order to
maintain equilibrium. We could find M by summing moments about any
point, but it is not needed in order to solve this problem.

The shear stress can now be calculated.

\[
\tau=\frac{V}{A}=\frac{9,000{~lb}}{60{~in.}^2}=150{~psi}
\]

At x = 80 ft:

\[
\sum F_y=15,000{~lb}-16,000{~lb}-V=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad V=-1,000{~lb}
\]

Note that the negative sign here simply indicates that V is acting in
the opposite direction of that drawn in the free body diagram. It can be
discarded here as we are calculating the magnitude of the average shear
stress at each point.

\[
\tau=\frac{V}{A}=\frac{1,000{~lb}}{60{~in.}^2}=16.7{~psi}
\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

Shear stresses are common in both members of a structure and also in the
fasteners between members. Depending on how these connections are formed
we may see multiple shear planes. It is very important to correctly
identify the internal force in the body. Figure 2.4 demonstrates the
difference between single and double shear configurations for a pinned
joint and the effects on internal shear force. See Example 2.4 for an
example where double shear occurs.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH2 figures/2.4.png}

\caption{Figure 2.4: Pins experiencing (a) single shear and (b) double
shear.}

A pin made of a tin alloy with an allowable shear stress of 3 ksi is
used to connect a footrest to the frame of a motorcycle. When in motion,
the footrest supports a load of 200 lb which is transferred to the pin.
Determine the required diameter of the pin such that the stress will not
exceed 5 ksi.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Average shear stress can be calculated from \(\tau=\frac{V}{A}\).
Rearrange this equation to \(A=\frac{V}{\tau}\). Start with a free body
diagram of the pin in order to determine the internal shear force.

From the diagram it should be apparent that the pin is in double shear
and the maximum internal shear force in the pin is 100 lb. Thus the
required cross-sectional area
\(A=\frac{100{~lb}}{3000{~psi}}=0.0333{~in.}^2\).

Since \(A=\frac{\pi}{4} d^2\) the required diameter is
\(d=\sqrt{\frac{0.0333{~in.}^2 * 4}{\pi}}=0.206{~in}\).

\section{Bearing Stress}\label{sec-2.3}

Click to expand

Bearing stress is similar to normal stress, except that it occurs at the
contact area between two bodies instead of within a single body. Bearing
stress is calculated with the average normal stress equation, where the
cross-sectional area is the contact area between the two bodies (Figure

One common situation is contact between two curved edges, such as the
bolt in Figure 2.6. In this situation it is common to use the projected
contact area between the curved surfaces, which forms a rectangle of
base d and height t. This greatly simplifies the calculation, but again
represents an average value for the contact or bearing stress.

\section{Stress on an Inclined Plane}\label{sec-2.4}

Click to expand

We have so far been cutting cross-sections perpendicular to the external
force, or parallel to it. However, there is no rule that says we have to
do this. It is perfectly acceptable to cut cross-sections at an angle
and there are many situations where it may make sense to do so (Figure
2.7).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH2 figures/2.7.png}

}

\caption{Figure 2.7: (a) External loads, F, will create (b) an internal
normal force, N, when a cross-section is cut vertically. (c) If the
cross-section is cut along an inclined plane the internal force, P, will
not be a normal force or shear force. (d) The internal force should be
broken into normal (N) and shear (V) components that are perpendicular
and parallel to the plane respectively.}

\end{figure}%

In this scenario the internal load must still be equal and opposite to
the external load in order to maintain equilibrium but, because we cut
the cross-section at an angle, this internal load is neither parallel
nor perpendicular to the cross-section. Therefore it is not entirely a
normal force or a shear force. However, the internal force may be broken
into components that are perpendicular and parallel to the
cross-section.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& N=P \sin (\theta) \\
& V=P \cos (\theta)
\end{aligned}
\]

The area used to calculate the average normal and shear stresses must be
the area of the inclined plane (Figure 2.8). By setting up a
right-angled triangle it should be apparent that the area of the plane,
A\textsubscript{p}, can be found from:

\[
A_p=\frac{A}{\sin (\theta)}
\]

We can calculate average normal stress from
\(\sigma=\frac{N}{A_p}=\frac{P \sin (\theta)}{\frac{A}{\sin (\theta)}}=\frac{P \sin ^2(\theta)}{A}\).

We can calculate average shear stress from
\(\tau=\frac{V}{A_p}=\frac{P \cos (\theta)}{\frac{A}{\sin (\theta)}}=\frac{P \sin (\theta) \cos (\theta)}{A}\).

Note these equations assume the angle (θ) is measured from the axis
perpendicular to area A. For a horizontal beam, area A is in the
vertical plane so angle θ is measured from the horizontal axis.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH2 figures/2.8.png}

}

\caption{Figure 2.8: When calculating the stresses on an inclined plane,
it is important to use the area of the plane, Ap, rather than the area
of the cross-sectional plane, A.}

\end{figure}%

Even if the external load remains constant, we can obtain different
values for the internal normal and shear forces (and therefore different
values for the stresses) by changing the angle at which we cut the
cross-section. We'll explore the implications of this further in
Chapter~\ref{sec-stress-transformation}. For now, a demonstration of
calculating the stresses on an inclined plane is given in Example 2.5.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 2.5}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A beam is formed of two structural wooden members that are glued
together along an inclined plane at angle θ = 40° and subjected to a
tensile force of F = 30 kN. The height of the beam is 50 mm and its
thickness is 20 mm. Determine the normal and shear stresses created
along the inclined plane.

\begin{center}

Begin by cutting a cross-section along the inclined plane and drawing a
free body diagram. Remember to include the internal normal and shear
forces perpendicular and parallel to the cross-section.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/CH2 figures/example 2.5 part 1 copy.png}
\end{center}

Use equilibrium equations to determine the internal forces. It will be
easiest to define axes parallel and perpendicular to the inclined plane.

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum F_{x^{\prime}}= F \cos (\theta)-V=0 \\
\sum F_{y^{\prime}}= N-F \sin (\theta)=0
\end{aligned}
\]

With F = 30 kN and θ = 40°, these can be solved for N = 19.3 kN and V =
23.0 kN.

Next, determine the cross-sectional area of the inclined plane.

\[
A_p=\frac{A}{\sin (\theta)}
\]

With \(A = 0.05{~m}*0.02{~m} = 0.001{~m}^2\) and \(θ = 40°\),
\(Ap = 0.00156{~m}^2\).

Finally, determine the average normal stress and the average shear
stress.

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sigma & =\frac{N}{A_p}=\frac{19,300{~N}}{0.00156{~m}^2}=12.4 \times 10^6 \frac{{N}}{m^2}=12.4{~MPa} \\
\tau & =\frac{V}{A_p}=\frac{23,000{~N}}{0.00156{~m}^2}=14.8 \times 10^6 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{m^2}=14.8{~MPa}

Objects under load will experience stress. It is the stress level
(rather than just the load by itself) that determines whether an object
will break under load. We can calculate the average normal stress and
average shear stress acting on a body, though a complete understanding
of the stress field within a complex object often requires more advanced
concepts.

Stress depends on the internal load in the body, the cross-sectional
area, and the orientation of the plane. Normal stress occurs when there
is an internal normal force and may be tensile or compressive. Shear
stress occurs when there is an internal shear force. Members may
commonly experience multiple shear planes.

If there are multiple loads acting on a body, or if the body has
multiple cross-sectional areas at different points, different parts of
the body may experience different stresses. In such cases, we may
calculate the stress in each part of the body by finding the internal
load and cross-sectional area in that part of the body. In this chapter
we have discussed average stress. In subsequent chapters further details
on stress distributions will be discussed.

Bearing stress is similar to normal stress, but occurs between two
bodies.

We may calculate stresses along inclined planes by cutting a
cross-section at an angle. Determining the stresses at different angles
will be important later in our studies.

\markright{Introduction}

Click to expand

In chapter 2 we learned how to calculate normal and shear stresses with
respect to a plane of interest, such as a cross-sectional area or an
inclined plane. If stresses get too large the object will break, so it
is important that engineers design structures and machines such that the
stresses stay within certain acceptable limits. It is also important
that objects do not deform so much that they are no longer fit for their
original purpose. Strain is a measure of the intensity of a
deformation---that is, the deformation per unit length.

Imagine two points on a body, A and B separated by some distance L
(figure 3.1). In statics (and dynamics), objects are assumed to be rigid
and they do not deform when subjected to forces. In reality, forces will
cause an object to deform and its dimensions will change. As points A
and B move with the object, the distance between them will change to
some new distance L'.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH3 PNGs/figure 3.1.png}

}

\caption{Figure 3.1: Nonrigid bodies will deform under load and the
distance between any two points A and B will change as the body
deforms.}

\end{figure}%

These deformations may be very large relative to the size of the object
(e.g., a rubber band) or they may be relatively small (e.g., structural
members) but there will always be some amount of deformation as no
material is infinitely stiff, as we will learn in chapter 4. Engineers
must design structures and machines such that these deformations are not
excessively large for the intended application.

This chapter will introduce two types of strain. Section 3.1 covers
normal strain which, like normal stress, occurs when objects are
subjected to axial loads. Section 3.2 covers shear strain which, like
shear stress, occurs when objects are subjected to shear loads.

\section{Normal Strain}\label{sec-3.1}

Click to expand

A simple example of normal strain is the deformation of a bar subjected
to an axial load. Consider a bar of length L subjected to a tensile
axial load P as shown in figure 3.2. The load will create a normal
stress in the rod and will also cause the rod to elongate by an amount
ΔL.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH3 PNGs/figure 3.2.png}

}

\caption{Figure 3.2: Axial loads cause a change in length that depends
partly on the original length of the object.}

\end{figure}%

If the same load were applied to a longer rod of length 2L with the same
cross-sectional area, the longer rod will elongate by an amount 2ΔL. The
deformation depends on the original length of the rod in this case, but
the strain does not. Strain is a measure that normalizes the change in
length by the original length. Normal strain is defined as:

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta L}{L}
\]

where

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ε = Normal strain
\item
  ΔL = Change in length {[}mm, in{]}
\item
  L = Original length {[}mm, in{]}
\end{itemize}

This is a normal strain because it occurs under axial load and is
associated with a change in length of the object. Since normal strain is
defined by dividing one length by another it does not have any units.
However, it is fairly common to still include units of mm/mm or in/in.

For example, if the rod was initially 5 m long and it elongated by 12
mm, the normal strain can be calculated as:

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta L}{L}=\frac{12}{5,000}=0.0024{~mm} /{mm}=0.0024
\]

Note that the units used for ΔL and L must be the same, but it does not
matter if they are expressed in mm or m. Using meters instead yields the
same answer:

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta L}{L}=\frac{0.012}{5}=0.0024{~m}/{m}=0.0024
\]

Because strains tend to be quite small in many engineering applications,
they are sometimes expressed with a prefix to eliminate the leading
zeros. For example, a strain of 0.0024 may be expressed as 2.4 mm/m or
2400 µm/m or simply 2400 µ. Strains may also be expressed as a
percentage, which can be found simply by multiplying the strain by
100\%. The below strains are all equivalent:

\[
\varepsilon=0.0024{~mm}/{mm}=0.0024{~m}/{m}=0.0024=2.4{~mm}/{m}=2400~\mu{m}/{m}=2400 ~\mu=0.24\%
\]

We will continue to use the sign convention that we defined for normal
stress. Tensile forces and stresses, which are associated with
elongation of the bar and tensile normal strain, are positive.
Compressive forces and stresses, which are associated with shortening of
the bar and compressive normal strain, are negative (figure 5.3).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH3 PNGs/figure 3.3.png}

}

\caption{Figure 3.3: (A) Objects in tension will elongate. By
convention, tension and elongation are positive. (B) Objects in
compression will shorten. By convention, compression and shortening are
negative.}

\end{figure}%

See example 3.1 for a problem involving a bar experiencing both tension
and compression. Example 3.2 involves strain in two parallel cables.

The bar is subjected to forces F1 = 30 kips and F2 = 10 kips as shown.
Segment AB is originally 10 inches in length and segment BC is
originally 15 inches in length. As a result of the applied forces, the
normal strain in segment AB is -- 0.03 in/in and the strain in segment
BC is 0.045 in/in.

Using \(\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta L}{L}\) for each segment, rearrange to
calculate the change in length of each segment.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta L_{A B}=\varepsilon_{A B} L_{A B}=-0.03 * 10\text{ in.}=-0.3 \text { in.} \\
& \Delta L_{B C}=\varepsilon_{B C} L_{B C}=0.045 * 15\text{ in.}=0.675 \text{ in.}
\end{aligned}
\]

To find the overall strain for the entire bar, first find the overall
change in length for the entire bar.

\[
\Delta L=-0.3\text{ in.}+0.675\text{ in.}=0.375 \text { in.}
\]

Overall, the bar elongates by 0.375 in. The original length of the bar
was 25 in. We can now determine the strain for the entire bar.

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta L}{L}=\frac{0.375\text{ in.}}{25\text{ in.}}=0.015 \text{ in./in.}

\[
\Delta L_D=\varepsilon L=2300 \times 10^{-6} * 3.5{~m}=0.00805 {~m}=8.05 {~mm}
\]

Point D will deflect downwards by 8.05 mm. Use similar triangles to find
the deflection of point B.

\[
\begin{gathered}
\frac{\Delta L_B}{6{~m}}=\frac{8.05{~mm}}{11{~m}} \\
\Delta L_B=\frac{6{~m} * 8.05{~mm}}{11{~m}}=4.39{~mm}
\end{gathered}
\]

Cable B will elongate by 4.39 mm. Use this to determine the strain in
cable B. Be careful to be consistent with units. Either use ΔL = 4.39 mm
and L = 2000 mm, or ΔL = 0.00439 m and L = 2 m.

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta L}{L}=\frac{4.39{~mm}}{2000{~mm}}=0.002195{~m}/{m}=2195 ~\mu{m} /{m}

\section{Shear Strain}\label{sec-3.2}

Click to expand

Consider a small, square element that may be part of a body such as that
shown in figure 3.1. As well as the distance between points changing as
the body deforms, the shape of this square element will also change. The
corners of the square element will initially form right-angles. As the
body deforms and the points move with the object, the shape of the
element changes and the corners no longer form right-angles (figure
3.4).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH3 PNGs/figure 3.4.png}

}

\caption{Figure 3.4: (a) The undeformed element is initially square,
with right-angled corners. (b) As the body deforms, the square element
skews and the corners are no longer right-angles.}

\end{figure}%

While normal strain represents a change in length, a shear strain
represents a change in angle---a distortion of the shape. Specifically,
provided we start with right-angled corners, shear strain is defined as
the original angle (before deformation) minus the new angle (after
deformation). Regardless of the shape of the body, a square element can
always be defined such that the original angle is always a right angle.
After deformation, the new angle between these three points is 𝜃'. Shear
strain is given the symbol γ and is, like normal strain, a dimensionless
quantity, so is represented in radians (not degrees). Thus the original
right angle is represented as \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians and the shear
strain as:

\[
\gamma=\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta^{\prime}
\]

Since we always subtract the new angle from the original angle, note
that if the angle increases we get a negative shear strain and if the
angle decreases we get a positive shear strain (figure 3.5).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.05208in,height=\textheight]{images/CH3 PNGs/figure 3.5.png}

}

\caption{Figure 3.5: (a) If the new angle 𝜃' is larger than
\(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians, the shear strain is negative. (b) If the new
angle 𝜃' is smaller than \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians, the shear strain is
positive.}

\end{figure}%

See examples 3.3 and 3.4 to practice calculating shear strain.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 3.3}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A thin rectangular plate has a base of 300 mm and a height of 500 mm.
Initially corners A, B, C, and D are all right-angles. The plate is
subjected to a shear force V which deforms the plate into the dotted
lines shown. Corner D moves straight downward by 5 mm. Determine the
shear strain at corner A.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.95833in,height=\textheight]{images/CH3 PNGs/example 3.3 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

We could calculate the new angle at corner A as
\(\theta^{\prime}=\frac{\pi}{2}+\alpha\).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.84375in,height=\textheight]{images/CH3 PNGs/example 3.3 part 2.png}
\end{center}

Angle α can be found since there is a triangle of base 300 mm and height
5 mm.

\[
\alpha=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{5}{300}\right)=0.01667 {~rad}
\]

Then:

\[
\theta^{\prime}=\frac{\pi}{2}+0.01667{~rad}=1.5875 {~rad}
\]

Now the shear strain can be calculated:

\[
\gamma=\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta^{\prime}=\frac{\pi}{2}-1.5875{~rad}=-0.01667 {~rad}
\]

Notice that this is just the negative of angle α. Since the shear strain
is the change in angle and α represents the increase of the angle, we
could have simply said that angle α is the shear strain. As defined in
section 3.2, the shear strain is negative because the angle is
increasing.

A thin triangular plate ABC has a base of 8 inches and a height of 20

load, the plate deforms as shown. Corner B moves 0.1 inches to the right
and corner C moves 0.06 inches downward. Determine the shear strain at
corner A.

The angle at A will decrease by angle α and increase by angle β. Start

The new angle at A will be:

\[
\theta^{\prime}=\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha+\beta=1.5708-0.005+0.0075=1.5733 \text{ rad}

With the new angle known, we can calculate the shear strain.

\[

Note that we could have calculated the shear strain more directly. Since
shear strain is just the change in angle, we could have said that the
angle at A decreases by angle α and increases by angle β.

Recall that shear strain is positive if the angle decreases and negative
if the angle increases. The change in angle at A, and thus the shear
strain, could be calculated as:

Objects may experience a change in length, for example due to axial
loads. If the load is tensile, the length will increase. If the load is
compressive, the length will decrease.

Normal strain is defined as the change in length divided by the original
length. Strain has no units, but is commonly written with units of mm/mm
or in./in. or similar. Normal strain is positive if the length increases
and negative if the length decreases.

Objects subjected to shear loads will experience a change in angle.
Shear strain is defined as this change in angle, expressed as original
angle -- new angle, where the original angle is always a right-angle.
Shear strains are positive if the angle decreases and negative if the
angle increases.

Shear strains are expressed in radians, not degrees, and so the original
angle is always defined as \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

Engineering design of structures meant to carry load often involves the
determination of geometries and sizes of the components involved that
will be needed to meet the design requirements. Possible design criteria
might be that the structure be capable of carrying anticipated loads
without failure (e.g., an aircraft wing), that it be stiff enough to
only deflect by a limited amount (e.g., a building girder), or that the
material returns to its original configuration when the loading is
removed (e.g., a 5 MPH bumper). Meeting these criteria requires us to
understand the behavior of the material or materials that are being used
within the structure. Exploring several of these basic mechanical
properties is the focus of this chapter. An understanding of material
behavior and these mechanical properties will enable us to relate
stresses to strains, temperature change to strains, and explore the
coupling that exists when subjecting materials to an arbitrary stress
states.

The material properties described in this chapter will vary among
materials. Material properties can be measured and recorded for
reference in engineering handbooks. Some useful material properties for
common engineering materials are recorded in Appendix C.

For the purposes of this book as we learn the principles, we assume that
mechanical properties are constant, i.e.~independent of temperature,
rate of loading, etc.. This assumption works well for many engineering
materials such as steel and aluminum at moderate temperatures, but
temperature and rate dependence can be important at very high
temperatures. Polymers, including plastics, rubber, etc. are known for
their significant temperature and time or rate dependence, sometimes at
common use temperatures, complicating the ability to tabulate these
properties in a simple table. Practicing engineers often need to
recognize and address such complications as they work with such
materials.

Of particular importance is that materials in this text are assumed to
be isotropic---that is, they have the same properties when loaded in
different directions. Anisotropic materials, which display different
properties depending on the direction of loading, are quite common but
are beyond the scope of this text.

\section{Tensile Test}\label{sec-4.1}

Click to expand

A common method of measuring mechanical properties of materials is the
tensile test, which involves placing a cylinder or bar of material in a
load frame (such as shown in Figure 4.1a) and subjecting the specimen to
tensile loading. These load frames are designed in such a manner that
they can mechanically extend the tensile bar, often to failure, while
measuring both the imposed load and the specimen deformation. These
quantities for the specimen are then used to determine the local or
material level behavior of stress and strain by using the relationships
covered in chapters 2 and 3. These latter quantities are often essential
in engineering design because properties from appropriate tests on
laboratory specimens may be used to predict the behavior of much more
complex engineering components.

During a typical tensile test, a specimen (such as shown in Figure 4.1b)
is mounted in grips that are then separated at a prescribed displacement
rate. To determine stress, the recorded force at any time is divided by
the cross-sectional area of the specimen. Because of the likelihood of
failures at the grip due to concentrations of stress, specimens are
typically ``waisted'' to form dogbone or dumbbell shapes. Large fillets
are used to reduce stress concentrations associated with the different
areas (See Section 5.2), and failure will typically occur within the
narrowed region of the specimen due to the smaller cross-sectional area.
This region is often referred to as the ``gage region'' as this becomes
the area of interest for the specimen. In addition, this specimen
produces a uniform uniaxial stress state within this gage region of the
specimen. The normal stress within this region is determined by:

\[
\sigma=\frac{F}{A}
\]

To determine strain, devices such as mechanical extensometer's (see
Figure 4.1c) are mounted on the specimen, measuring the deflection and
dividing it by the original distance between the contact points.~ The
axial normal strain is determined by dividing the measured extension by
the active length of the strain measuring device, typically a portion of
the gage section of the specimen:

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta L}{L}
\]

\section{Stress/Strain Diagram}\label{sec-4.2}

Click to expand

The goal in conducting tests of materials, such as the tensile test
described above, is to learn qualitatively how the specimen responds and
to quantitatively determine important mechanical properties of the
material.

As discussed in the introduction to this chapter, these material
properties will be assumed to be constant in this text and so, once
determined from a test specimen, can be used to design and analyze
components made of that same material. Appendix C contains material
properties for a selection of these materials.

Figure 4.2a illustrates representative stress-strain behavior for
several engineering materials.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH4 PNGs/4.2.png}

}

\caption{Figure 4.2: Results obtained from tensile tests. (a)
Illustration of a typical stress-strain behavior for \_\_\_\_\_\_,
\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_. (b) Failure surfaces for cast iron,
mild steel, and an aluminum alloy.}

\end{figure}%

Each material initially experiences a linear relationship between stress
and strain, represented as a straight line on the stress/strain diagram.
This linear portion is referred to as elastic deformation. One important
property of elastic deformation is that if an object is loaded into the
elastic region (causing a certain amount of stress and strain) and the
load is subsequently removed, the object will return to its original
dimensions.

Materials such as glass, silicon wafers, and concrete tend to be quite
brittle, breaking prior to significant permanent or plastic deformation.
The behavior remains nearly linear until failure, an attribute of
brittle materials. On the other hand, certain copper alloys, mild steel,
and many polymers are often quite ductile, meaning that there is
considerable plastic deformation beyond some limiting value of stress or
strain. Unless a material is perfectly brittle, there will be a certain
point beyond which the relationship between stress and strain becomes
nonlinear, represented by a curve departing from linear elastic behavior
on the stress/strain diagram. This nonlinear (often curved) portion is
referred to as plastic deformation. If an object is loaded into the
plastic region and the load is subsequently removed, any plastic
deformation is permanent, and the object will not return to its original
dimensions.

The transition between the linear region of the stress-strain curve and
the subsequent behavior marks an important engineering property of the
material known as the yield stress. Although considerable variations are
seen among different materials, yielding is typically defined as the
region within which relatively small increases in stress are associated
with relatively large increases in strain. The yield strength of the
material is a very important design parameter, as many engineering
components are designed to operate within the linear region of material
response, and hence remain elastic, i.e., the ability to return to their
original configuration when loading is removed. You likely have
experienced material yielding if you have ever deformed a coat hanger or
paperclip such that it does not return to the original state. Such
behavior is undesirable for many engineering components designed to
continue operating in their original state. On the other hand, plastic
deformation following yielding can be very important in terms of the
fabrication process. For example sheets of steel or aluminum can be
placed between molds and compressed under high pressure to deform them
into the shape of an automobile panel as seen in figure 4.3a, an
illustration of where plastic deformation is very important. Plastic
deformation can also be useful in absorbing energy, such as seen in the
concertina crushing of a structural component for an automobile (see
figure 4.3b). This book, however, will focus on the pre-yield, linear
elastic region.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH4 PNGs/4.3.png}

}

\caption{Figure 4.3: Engineering materials are often loaded beyond yield
to permanently deform the material, as in (a) the stamping process for
an automotive panel or in (b) the crushing of a weld-bonded hat section
used to absorb energy in an automobile accident.}

\end{figure}%

Sometimes the yield region is further described by three distinct points
on the stress/strain curve. The proportional limit marks the point where
the relationship between stress and strain stops being linear. The
elastic limit marks the point beyond which materials do not return to
their original state. The yield point is typically defined using the
0.2\% offset method where a straight line beginning at a strain of 0.002
(0.2\%) and running parallel to the linear portion of the diagram is
drawn. The point where this line intersects the stress/strain curve is
defined as the yield point. Since these three points for a material
often occur within a fairly narrow range of one another, this text will
refer to these three points collectively as yielding, and will define
the stress at this point as the yield strength. Figure 4.4 illustrates
these definitions.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH4 PNGs/4.4.png}

}

\caption{Figure 4.4: Illustration of the proportional limit, the elastic
limit, and the yield region of material response.}

\end{figure}%

Other metrics are also often quantitatively evaluated from stress-strain
diagrams, including the ultimate strength, \(\sigma_{alt}\), the maximum
stress achieved prior to failure and the strain at break,
\(\varepsilon_{break}\) which is a measure of the ultimate elongation
capabilities of the material (though is often dependent on the size of
the specimen's gage length.

\section{Hooke's Law}\label{sec-4.3}

Click to expand

The slope of the linear region of this stress/strain diagram represents
an important material property known as Young's modulus or the modulus
of elasticity, which will be designated by E. The elastic modulus can be
thought of as a measure of stiffness of the material. A high elastic
modulus for `stiff' materials is represented by a steep slope. That is,
a large increase in stress with only a small increase in strain. A low
elastic modulus for `soft' materials is represented by a shallow slope
indicating a small increase in stress but a large increase in strain.

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist)}{Thomas
Young} (1773-1829) was a British scientist, who noted the
proportionality between applied force and extension, which he recorded
as ``ut tensio sic vis'', meaning ``as is the extension, so is the
force''.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=2.88542in,height=\textheight]{images/CH4 PNGs/4.5.jpeg}

}

\caption{Figure 4.5: Thomas Young}

\end{figure}%

The linear elastic region of material response is of enormous importance
for most engineering structures. Loading significantly beyond this
proportional limit can result in pronounced yielding and permanent
deformation that is often unacceptable, unless one is using this
deformation to absorb energy (as in automobile frame involved in
collision). Young's modulus or the modulus of elasticity is illustrated
in figure 4.5a, which plots a portion of the normal stress versus normal
strain, for example from a tensile test.

\[
E=\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}
\]

Since strain is unitless, elastic modulus will have the same units as
stress {[}Pa or psi{]}.

This relationship is more commonly called Hooke's Law, and written in
the form:

\[
\sigma=E \varepsilon
\]

It is especially important to note that this relationship is only
applicable within the linear elastic region of the material's response.
Use of this relationship beyond this region can lead to serious design
mistakes. One should note that this proportionality, applicable at the
material level for stress and strain, also extends to structural
elements, such as bars in tension or compression, beam deflections,
helical springs in which the force and deflection are related by the
spring constant, and many other engineering components and structures,
as will be covered in the following chapters of the book.

Example 4.1 uses Hooke's law to determine the elastic modulus of a
material where the applied load and deformation are known.

\section{Poisson's Ratio}\label{sec-4.4}

Click to expand

When you stretch a rubber band, you will note that the elastomer
elongates in the axial direction but that the cross-sectional area
contracts. That is, there is a normal strain in the longitudinal
(length) direction and also in the lateral (width or thickness)
direction. There is a coupling between these normal strains in
perpendicular directions. Poisson's ratio is the material property that
describes the proportional relationship between longitudinal and lateral
strains. Named after Siméon Denis Poisson (1781-1840), the French
mathematician and physicist, Poisson's ratio is defined as the negative
of the lateral strain divided by the longitudinal strain for a uniaxial
eight loaded material. It may be expressed as:

\[
\nu=-\frac{\varepsilon_{\text {lateral }}}{\varepsilon_{\text {longitudinal }}}
\]

Note that this relationship is appropriate for a uniaxially loaded
specimen (i.e., when a load is applied in only the longitudinal
direction). Section 4.8 expands this relationship to cases where normal
stresses are present in more than one direction. Poisson's ratio is a
material property that depends on the material as well as its structure.
Theoretically, Poisson's ratio can range from --1 to ½ for isotropic
materials, but usually ranges from near zero for foams to nearly ½ for
soft materials such as elastomers and gels. Most metals fall in the
range from 0.2 to 0.35. A positive value of Poisson's ratio means that
as the material is extended in one direction, there will be a
contraction in lateral directions. Most solid materials have positive
Poisson's ratios, though negative values have been reported in auxetic
materials, such as certain meta-materials fabricated using additive
manufacturing processes. Although beyond the scope of this course, such
materials offer intriguing design possibilities. See example 4.2 for a
simple application of Poisson's ratio.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 4.2}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A circular polymeric rod with a diameter of 10 mm is subjected to a
uniaxial force, resulting in an axial strain of 0.5\%. A corresponding
reduction in diameter of 0.02 mm is measured. Determine the Poisson's
ratio of this material.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

\end{center}

The longitudinal strain is given as: ε\textsubscript{longitudinal} =
0.005

The lateral strain is determined from the reduction in diameter divided
by the original diameter, and is negative because it is contracting:
\(\varepsilon_{\text{lateral}}=\frac{-0.02{~mm}}{10{~mm}}=-0.002\)

Poisson's ratio is then easily determined as:
\(\nu=-\frac{\varepsilon_{\text {lateral }}}{\varepsilon_{\text {longitudinal }}}=-\frac{-0.002}{0.005}=0.4\)

\section{Shear Stress/Strain}\label{sec-4.5}

Click to expand

In addition to considering normal stresses and strains, an understanding
of the relationship between shear stresses and shear strains is also
needed. A similar experiment can be performed to produce a diagram of
shear stress against shear strain. The slope of a shear stress versus
shear strain diagram is referred to as the shear modulus or modulus of
rigidity, and will be designated by G. The corresponding slope of a
shear stress versus shear strain plot is referred to as the shear
modulus or modulus of rigidity, as shown in figure 4.5b.

\[
\tau=G \gamma
\]

where \(G\) is the shear modulus or modulus of rigidity, \(\tau\) is the
shear stress, and \(\gamma\) is the shear strain. It should be noted
that Young's modulus, the shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, and the bulk
modulus (to be defined in Section 4.8) are not all independent of one
another. For isotropic materials, there are only two independent, linear
elastic properties; knowing any two allows one to calculate the others.
It can be shown that:

\[
G=\frac{E}{2(1+v)}
\]

See example 4.3 for a problem involving the shear modulus.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 4.3}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Soft contact lenses often consist of a hydrogel, an elastomeric network
that is imbibed with water, expanding its volume and making the lens
more soft and compliant. Suppose a 10 mm cube of the dry elastomer were
subjected to a shearing action as shown. Shearing forces of 5 N each are

\section{Thermal Strain}\label{sec-4.6}

Click to expand

In addition to relationships arising between stress and strain, other
factors can affect dimensional changes of materials as well as changes
in the stresses present in a structure. Most materials will expand, for
example, when their temperature is increased. Many engineering
structures will experience significant temperature variations during
their life, beginning with thermal processes involved in their
manufacture, cyclic temperature changes (e.g., day/night or
summer/winter), or because of their usage, such as an engine block
heating up or cooling down. Though dimensional changes from temperature
often appear to be quite small, they can lead to significant changes in
stress state, and in fact numerous failures result not from applied
mechanical loading but from thermal exposure issues. Though beyond the
current scope, other dimensional changes can also result from other
environmental factors, such as the expansion of a material as water is
absorbed, or from the application of electric fields for materials that
exhibit piezoelectric properties.

Vibrational energy of atoms increases as temperature increases,
typically leading to slightly greater atomic separation distances. This
expansion leads to dimensional changes in the material, and the behavior
is characterized by the material's coefficient of thermal expansion
(CTE). The linear CTE is often designated by \(\alpha\) and is defined
as the change in strain per unit change in temperature. As with the
other material properties discussed in this chapter, \(\alpha\) is
assumed to be constant for any given material.

The CTE is independent of direction in isotropic materials. One may
determine the CTE by heating or cooling a specimen and measuring the
resulting strain (ε) or dimensional change and recording the change in
temperature (ΔT):

\[
\alpha=\frac{\varepsilon}{\Delta T}=\frac{\frac{\Delta L}{L}}{\Delta T}
\]

where \(\Delta T=T_{\text {final }}-T_{\text {initial }}\). Since strain
is unitless, CTE has units of \(\frac{1}{{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}\) or
\(\frac{1}{{ }^{\circ} F}\). Knowing the CTE, one can easily determine
the strain expected when a material is subjected to a temperature change
of ΔT:

\[
\varepsilon=\alpha \cdot \Delta T
\]

Or dimensional changes can be determined as:

\[
\Delta L=\alpha \cdot \Delta T \cdot L
\]

See example 4.4 for a problem involving a temperature change resulting
in a thermal strain.

\section{Multiaxial or Generalized Hooke's Law}\label{sec-4.7}

Click to expand

Materials are often tested under idealized conditions, such as uniaxial
tension or shearing resulting from torsional loading. These tests are
important because they provide material properties necessary for
engineering design. Such simple stress states are less common in actual
engineered components, where more complex, multiaxial stress states are
present, as shown in figure 4.6.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4.40625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH4 PNGs/4.7.png}

}

\caption{Figure 4.7: Illustration of a general, multiaxial stress state,
showing normal and shear stresses acting on the positive x, y, and z
planes. (Similar stresses act on the opposite sides, but are hidden.
?????{[}text{]} (a) represents tensional notation and (b) shows
engineering notation, as will be used herein.}

\end{figure}%

Here there are three normal stresses, referred to with a single
subscript indicating their direction (σ\textsubscript{x},
σ\textsubscript{y}, and σ\textsubscript{z}). There are six shear
stresses, designated by τ, which are referred to with two subscripts,
one indicating the plane or `face' that the stress acts on and the other
indicating the direction that it acts in. For example, on the y-z plane
(the x-face) there is the normal stress σ\textsubscript{x} and two shear
stresses, τ\textsubscript{xy} and τ\textsubscript{xz}. The first
subscript indicates that these shear stresses act on the x-face and the
second subscript indicates that they point in the y- and z-directions
respectively.

Consider the x-y plane of the stress element in figure 4.7. This 2D
plane is shown in figure 4.8. It experiences two normal stresses
(σ\textsubscript{x} and σ\textsubscript{y}) and two shear stresses
(τ\textsubscript{xy} and τ\textsubscript{yx}). τ\textsubscript{xy} will
cause the element to rotate counterclockwise while τ\textsubscript{yx}
will cause the element to rotate clockwise. For an element in
equilibrium, these two stresses must be equal in order for these
rotation effects to balance. Expanding this to the other planes we may
say τ\textsubscript{xy} = τ\textsubscript{yx}, τ\textsubscript{xz} =
τ\textsubscript{zx}, and τ\textsubscript{yz} = τ\textsubscript{zy}.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.30208in,height=\textheight]{images/CH4 PNGs/4.8.png}

}

\caption{Figure 4.8: 2D view of the x-y plane of a 3D stress element.}

\end{figure}%

Having learned the concept of Poisson's ratio, we recognize that there
is a coupling between normal stresses in one direction and the normal
strains in other directions. We have reviewed this in the context of the
response to the application of a uniaxial stress state---a normal stress
applied in only one direction. For example, if there is a normal stress
in the x-direction there will also be a normal strain in the x-direction
and also in the y- and z-directions.

Specifically:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon_x=\frac{\sigma_x}{E} \\
& \varepsilon_y=-v \varepsilon_x=-\frac{\nu \sigma_x}{E} \\
& \varepsilon_z=-\nu \varepsilon_x=-\frac{\nu \sigma_x}{E}
\end{aligned}
\]

Most engineering structures, however, involve more complex stress
states, in which stresses may be applied in the x-, y-, and
z-directions. We refer to these as multiaxial stress states. We can
define similar equations for a normal stress applied in the y-direction:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon_y=\frac{\sigma_y}{E} \\
& \varepsilon_x=-\nu \varepsilon_y=-\frac{\nu \sigma_y}{E} \\
& \varepsilon_z=-\nu \varepsilon_y=-\frac{\nu \sigma_y}{E}
\end{aligned}
\]

And for a normal stress applied in the z-direction:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon_z=\frac{\sigma_z}{E} \\
& \varepsilon_x=-\nu \varepsilon_z=-\frac{\nu \sigma_z}{E} \\
& \varepsilon_y=-\nu \varepsilon_z=-\frac{\nu \sigma_z}{E}
\end{aligned}
\]

If loads are applied in all 3 directions simultaneously, we can
determine the overall strain in each direction by simply adding together
the above components:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon_x=\frac{\sigma_x}{E}-\frac{\nu \sigma_y}{E}-\frac{\nu \sigma_z}{E}=\frac{1}{E}\left[\sigma_x-\nu\left(\sigma_y+\sigma_z\right)\right] \\
& \varepsilon_y=\frac{1}{E}\left[\sigma_y-\nu\left(\sigma_x+\sigma_z\right)\right] \\
& \varepsilon_z=\frac{1}{E}\left[\sigma_z-\nu\left(\sigma_x+\sigma_y\right)\right]
\end{aligned}
\]

This is the generalized Hooke's law for the 3-dimensional state of
stress. Example problem 4.5 demonstrates the application of the
generalized Hooke's law to a problem with stresses acting in the x-, y-,
and z-directions.

We may make similar observations about strain, where normal strains are
written with a single subscript as ε\textsubscript{x},
ε\textsubscript{y}, and ε\textsubscript{z}. Shear strains are written
with 2 subscripts as γ\textsubscript{xy} = γ\textsubscript{yx},
γ\textsubscript{xz} = γ\textsubscript{zx}, and γ\textsubscript{yz} =
γ\textsubscript{zy}.

The relationships between shear stresses and strains do not change in
isotropic materials subjected to additional other stress components, so:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \gamma_{xy}=\frac{\tau_{xy}}{G} \\
& \gamma_{yz}=\frac{\tau_{yz}}{G} \\
& \gamma_{xz}=\frac{\tau_{xz}}{G}
\end{aligned}
\]

A solid, 50 mm polycarbonate cube is subjected to a compressive stress
of \(p=10 \mathrm{MPa}\) on all sides. Assuming the material has a
Young's modulus of 3 GPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.38, what is the
change in length of one of the edges?

First, we note that a compressive stress acts in all directions, so
\(\sigma_x=\sigma_y=\sigma_z=-p=-10{~MPa}\). We can choose any one of
the generalized Hooke's law equations to determine the strain in the
corresponding direction but note that all normal strains will be the
same.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon_x=\frac{1}{E}\left[\sigma_x-v\left(\sigma_y+\sigma_z\right)\right] \\
& \varepsilon=\frac{-p}{E}[1-2 v] \\
& \varepsilon=\frac{-10 {~MPa}}{3{~GPa}}[1-2*0.38]=-~0.0008=-~0.08 \%
\end{aligned}
\]

If one used the simple uniaxial Hooke's law,
\(\sigma=\mathrm{E} \varepsilon\), one would erroneously obtain a strain
of -0.33\% and a change in length of --0.167 mm, more than four times
the correct answer!

\section{Allowable Stress/Safety Factor}\label{sec-4.8}

Click to expand

Safety is of primary importance in engineering practice, and various
engineering principles and codes are built on the necessity of
considering the safety of products we design. The concept is that we
would determine the location and magnitude of the maximum stresses under
the most stringent anticipated loading conditions and compare these
predicted values with the failure stress, such as the yield or ultimate
strength of a material. Rather than allowing the maximum anticipated
stress to equal the failure stress, however, products are often designed
so that the maximum allowable stress is only some fraction of the
failure stress, leading to a more conservative design. Essentially, the
failure stress is scaled back by the factor of safety (F.S.), a quantity
that is greater than one.

\[
\sigma_{\text {allow }}=\frac{\sigma_{\text {fail }}}{F . S .}
\]

Example problem 4.6 demonstrates a simple calculation of the factor of
safety based on the failure and allowable stresses in a component. In
practice it is also common to work the other way and, starting with a
defined factor of safety and failure stress, calculate the allowable
stress in a component made of a given material.

Making the factor of safety larger, in principle, should make the
structure less likely to fail, but there are often weight, cost,
environmental, and functional penalties associated with higher F.S.
values. If the F.S. value is too small, the margin of safety for the
design may become unacceptable. Unexpected overload situations,
engineering design and assumption errors, and general wear and tear of a
material over time, including in challenging environments, could lead to
failure. The consequences of failures can range from minor
inconveniences all the way to major catastrophes with significant loss
of life and property. Negative publicity and attitudes towards even
minor failures can be of concern to customers and significantly reduce
future product sales, so product engineering involves risk assessment
and mitigation, in addition to production costs and other factors.

Safe design philosophies are often industry-specific and may be much
more involved and complicated than our simple factor of safety concept
conveys. For our purposes, suffice it to say that larger factors of
safety are often used when there is less certainty about our designs,
the loads our structures might sustain, or the severity of environmental
and use conditions. Larger factors of safety are often required when the
consequences of failure are considered to be greater. For example,
design of a theatre that could be filled with hundreds of people might
use a higher F.S. than that employed for a storage building that is
seldom occupied.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 4.6}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A 2 mm diameter steel wire is used to suspend a mass of 40 kg. Using the
yield strength of 200 MPa as the allowable stress, what is the factor of
safety of the wire (ignoring end and dynamic effects)?

First determine the normal force in the wire caused by the mass.

\[
P=40{~kg} * 9.81~\frac{{m}}{{s}^2}=392~\frac{{kg} \cdot {m}}{{s}^2}=392{~N} \\
\]

The actual stress allowed in the wire can be calculated from:

\[
\sigma=\frac{N}{A}=\frac{392{~N}}{\pi*(0.001{~m})^2}=124.8{~MPa}
\]

Now the factor of safety can be determined.

\[
F.S.=\frac{\sigma_{fail}}{\sigma_{allow}}=\frac{200{~MPa}}{124.8{~MPa}}=1.60
\]

The mechanical properties of materials need to be known for engineering
design purposes. For many applications, the linear elastic properties
are the first step in characterizing a material and in designing to
determine stresses resulting from imposed displacements or strains and
deflections caused by imposed loading scenarios.

Tensile tests of material samples are a common means to measure material
behavior, both in the linear elastic region and beyond.

Tensile tests can provide the normal stress-strain behavior, and the
Young's modulus (or modulus of elasticity) is defined as the slope of
the linear portion of this curve.

The proportional limit, elastic limit, and yield point of some
engineering materials are quite similar, and the yield strength will be
used throughout the book to denote this region of material response.

Because safe designs often involve materials being used below their
yield strength, the linear elastic properties---moduli and Poisson's
ratio---are important parameters for engineering design.

Poisson's ratio characterizes the coupling between normal stresses in
one direction and strains in lateral directions through the generalized
Hooke's law.

The shear modulus (or modulus of rigidity) relates shear stresses and
shear strains in the linear elastic region.

The factor of safety is one simple means to quantify how conservative a
design may be, an important parameter in engineering design.

In this chapter we'll take a closer look at the effects of axial
loading. Axial loads are those applied perpendicular to the
cross-section of an object (Figure 5.1) and such loads affect the object
in several ways.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.76042in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Figure 5.1.png}

}

\caption{Figure 5.1: Axial loads act perpendicular to the cross-section.
They cause normal stress on the cross-section and normal strains in both
the axial (A) and transverse (T) directions.}

\end{figure}%

Axial loads create axial stresses, which we have already seen in
Section~\ref{sec-2.1} and we'll revisit briefly in Section 5.1. We
previously considered the average normal stress in a cross-section, but
the geometry of the cross-section can cause large localized stresses
much higher than the average. We'll discuss these stress concentrations
in Section 5.2.

This text is concerned with both stress and deformation, so in Section
5.3 we'll explore the deformation caused by axial loads. We'll extend
this to a special case of axial deformation involving parallel bars in
Section 5.4, before using our knowledge of axial deformation to help us
solve statically indeterminate problems in Section 5.5. These are
problems where the equilibrium equations are not sufficient to determine
the reaction and internal forces.

Finally we'll investigate the effects of temperature in Section 5.6. As
the temperature of an object changes it will expand or contract. Thus
there can be deformation even in the absence of any applied forces.

\section{Axial Stress}\label{sec-5.1}

Click to expand

Axial loads create axial stresses, also known as normal stresses. As
discussed in Section 2.1, the average normal stress is calculated from

\[
\sigma=\frac{N}{A}\]

\emph{where}

\emph{𝜎 = Average normal stress {[}Pa, psi{]}}

\emph{N = Internal normal force {[}N, lb{]}}

\emph{A = Cross-sectional area {[}m\textsuperscript{2},
in.\textsuperscript{2}{]}}

\section{Stress Concentrations}\label{sec-5.2}

Click to expand

The normal stress discussed in the previous section is averaged over the
cross-section and assumes that stresses (and therefore strains) at the
cross-section are uniform. In reality stresses and strains can vary
across a cross-section, especially if the cross-section is close to an
applied load, a support, or a change in geometry. At these points
localized stress concentrations occur, leading to large, localized
stresses and strains. The intensity of these concentrations depends on
the type of loading, support, or geometry (Figure 5.2).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.89583in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Figure 5.2.png}

}

\caption{Figure 5.2: Each bar has a fixed support on the left, a
cross-section of 30 in.², and is subjected to a force of 10,000 lb. The
top bar is uniform and experiences a uniform average normal stress of
\$\textbackslash sigma=\textbackslash frac\{10000\}\{30\}=333\$ psi at
all points, except those close to the support and load. The bottom bar
experiences the same stress at most points, but significantly higher
stress concentrations close to the hole.}

\end{figure}%

However, these effects disappear a certain distance away from the force,
support, or local geometry. It is therefore acceptable to assume uniform
stress and strain (as we have been so far) provided that we also assume
our cross-section is a sufficient distance away from these points. This
is known as Saint-Venant's principle, which can be formally stated as
``The stresses and strains created at a point in a body by two
statically equivalent loads are equivalent at points sufficiently far
removed from the applied load'' (Figure 5.3).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.88542in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Figure 5.3.png}

}

\caption{Figure 5.3: Two statically equivalent loads applied to a bar.
Close to the point of application there will be localized stresses and
deformations, but at a cross-section sufficiently far away from the
applied loads the internal effects are equivalent.}

\end{figure}%

More advanced courses will use the theory of elasticity to study the
areas of variable stress and strain, but for now we'll continue to apply
Saint-Venant's principle and assume that our cross-sections are
sufficiently far away from the applied loads that we don't need to
consider these stress concentrations. We will however address the
question of stress concentrations around changes in geometry here. We'll
study two specific examples; holes and fillets. Figure 5.2 shows an
example of the stress concentrations around a hole. Figure 5.4 shows an
example of the stress concentrations around a fillet. A fillet is a
rounded corner used to help transition between two geometries.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/PNGs/Figure 5.4.png}

}

\caption{Figure 5.4: The fillet helps prevent a sharp corner but still
causes stress concentrations. The bar has a thickness of 3 in. The
height of the smaller section is 6 in. and the larger section is 10 in.
The applied load is 10,000 kips, so the average normal stress in the
smaller section is 556 psi and in the larger section is 333 psi. The
maximum stress at the fillet however is 973 psi.}

\end{figure}%

Fully modeling these stress concentrations is very complicated, but for
our purposes it is sufficient to find only the maximum stress that
occurs around these stress concentrations. These can be significantly
larger than the average stress we have been calculating, and can cause
localized failure even if the average stress is below the yield stress
for the material. The maximum stress can be found simply by multiplying
the average stress by a stress concentration factor, K.

\[
\sigma_{\text {max }}=K \sigma_{\text {avg }}\]

\emph{where}

\emph{𝜎\textsubscript{max} = Maximum normal stress {[}Pa, psi{]}}

\emph{K = Stress concentrtion factor {[}unitless{]}}

\emph{𝜎\textsubscript{avg} = Average normal stress {[}Pa, psi{]}}

This stress concentration factor depends on the geometry at hand and can
be found from curves in design handbooks (Figure 5.5). See Examples 5.1
and 5.2 to see how these curves can be used.

A hole is drilled through a steel plate to allow two components to be

If the plate is subjected to an axial load of P = 50 kN, determine the
maximum stress in the plate if the hole diameter d = 20 mm.

The connecting rod has two holes and a fillet. We can start by

average normal stress and then use the appropriate stress concentration
curve to determine the maximum normal stress.

\section{Axial Deformation}\label{sec-5.3}

Click to expand

Consider a simple bar of uniform cross-section subjected to an axial
force (Figure 5.6).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.48958in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Figure 5.6.png}

}

\caption{Figure 5.6: A bar of uniform cross-section, A, and length, L,
subjected to axial load, F.}

\end{figure}%

Assuming elastic behavior, we have equations for stress and strain, as
well as Hooke's law which relates the two equations:

\[
\begin{aligned} & \sigma=\frac{F}{A} \\ & \varepsilon_{\text {long }}=\frac{\Delta L}{L} \\ & \sigma=E \varepsilon_{\text {long }}\end{aligned}\]

Replacing the stress and strain terms in Hooke's law:

\[
\frac{F}{A}=E \frac{\Delta L}{L}\]

Rearranging:

\[
\Delta L=\frac{F L}{A E}\]

\emph{where}

\emph{ΔL = Change in length {[}m, in.{]}}

\emph{F = internal axial load {[}N, lb{]}}

\emph{L = Original length {[}m, in.{]}\$}

\emph{A = Cross-sectional area {[}m\textsuperscript{2},
in.\textsuperscript{2}{]}}

\emph{E = Elastic modulus {[}Pa, psi{]}}

This equation can be used to directly find the change in length of an
object subjected to an axial load.

In practice, there may be multiple axial loads applied to the bar. The
cross-sectional area may change at different points along the bar, or
perhaps there could be different materials with different elastic moduli
connected in series to form the bar. In any of these cases we can split
the bar into sections where each section has a constant F, A, and E. We
can calculate the change in length of each section separately and sum
them to find the total. See Example 5.3 for a problem involving multiple
segments of a bar.

\[
\Delta L=\sum \frac{F L}{A E}\]

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 5.3}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A component is made by welding together 2 circular rods. Rod (1) is made
of steel (E = 29 x 10\textsuperscript{6} psi) and is hollow, with an
outer diameter of 4 in. and an inner diameter of 2 in. Rod (2) is made
of copper (E = 17 x 10\textsuperscript{6} psi) and is solid, with a
diameter of 5 in. If the component is subjected to the axial loads
shown, determine the total deformation of the component.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/PNGs/Example 5.3 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

We can find the change in length of the component using
\(\Delta L=\sum \frac{F L}{A E}\).

First, break the component into three segments and determine the
internal load in each segment. The first segment covers the 9-inch steel
rod. After the first 9 inches of the component, both the cross-sectional
area and elastic modulus change so a second segment is needed. This
segment covers the next 4 inches. At this point the loading changes, so
a third segment is required to cover the final 10 inches of the
component.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.625in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.3 part 2.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{gathered}
N_1=N_2=60{~kips} \\
N_3=-20{~kips}
\end{gathered}
\]

Now calculate the deformation of each segment. Be sure to use the
appropriate dimensions and material properties for each segment.

Cross-sectional areas:

\[
\begin{gathered}
A_1=\pi*(2^2-1^2){~in.}^2=9.42{~in.}^2 \\
A_2=\pi*(2.5^2){~in.}^2=19.6{~in.}^2
\end{gathered}
\]

Deformation of segment 1:

\[
\Delta L_1=\frac{60000{~lb} * 9{~in.}}{9.42{~in.}^2 * 29 \times 10^6\frac{lb}{in^2}}=0.00198{~in.}
\]

Deformation of segment 2:

\[
\Delta L_2=\frac{60000{~lb} * 4{~in.}}{19.6{~in.}^2 * 17 \times 10^6\frac{lb}{in.^2}}=0.000719{~in} .
\]

Deformation of segment 3:

\[
\Delta L_3=\frac{-20000{~lb} * 10{~in.}}{19.6{~in.}^2 * 17 \times 10^6\frac{lb}{in.^2}}=-0.000599{~in.}
\]

Note that segment 3 is in compression and so gets shorter, while
segments 1 and 2 are in tension and so get longer. The total deformation
in the component is simply the sum of these three deformations.

\[
\Delta L=0.00198{~in.}+0.000719{~in.}-0.000599{~in.}=0.002{~in.}
\]

\section{Deformation in Series of Bars}\label{sec-5.4}

Click to expand

Sometimes a structure will have more than one axially loaded member. In
such cases there are multiple bars that will experience a change in
length and the amount of deformation won't necessarily be the same in
each member. The deformable members are generally connected by a rigid
(nondeformable) beam. These problems generally involve a little geometry
alongside our deformation equation (Figure 5.6).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.75in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Figure 5.7.png}

}

\caption{Figure 5.6: Rigid beam AB is attached to deformable poles 1 and
2. The poles may deform different amounts so point A is displaced by
amount ΔL\textsubscript{1}, point B by amount ΔL\textsubscript{2}, and
point C by an amount in between these two values.}

\end{figure}%

By identifying the force in each member through equilibrium, we may
calculate the deformation of each member separately using:

\[
\Delta L=\frac{F L}{A E}\]

Once the change in length of each member is known, we can find the
displacement at different points on the rigid beam through simple
geometry of the rigid beam (Figure 5.7). This process is demonstrated in
Example 5.4.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.42708in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Figure 5.8.png}

}

\caption{Figure 5.7: Beam deflection in the case where only bar 2
deforms. Point B will deflect downward by amount ΔL\textsubscript{2}.
The deflection at point C can be determined through geometry.}

\end{figure}%

The deflection of point C will be somewhere between the deflection at A
and the deflection at B. Assuming there is no deflection at A and
assuming that the deflections (and therefore the angle at A) are small,
we can use similar triangles to find:

\[
\frac{\Delta L_C}{L_{A C}}=\frac{\Delta L_2}{L} \rightarrow \Delta L_C=\Delta L_2 \frac{L_{A C}}{L}\]

If there is a deflection at point A (Figure 5.8) this simply becomes:

\[
\Delta L_C=\Delta L_1+\left(\Delta L_2-\Delta L_1\right) \frac{L_{A C}}{L}\]

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.94792in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Figure 5.9.png}

\caption{Figure 5.8: Similar triangles for calculating deflection at a
point when both bars experience a change in length.}

A rigid beam is supported by two non-rigid poles and subjected to a
distributed load w = 75 kN/m. Pole 1 is made of steel (E = 200 GPa) and
has a diameter of 30 mm. Pole 2 is made of cast iron (E = 70 GPa) and
has a diameter of 50 mm. Determine the deflection at point C of the
rigid beam.

Although the beam is rigid, poles 1 and 2 will both elongate. We can
find the force in each pole by drawing a free body diagram and applying
equilibrium equations.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.55208in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.4 part 2.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sum M_A=-(600{~kN}* 8{~m})+(F_2 * 12{~m})=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad F_2=400{~kN} \\
\sum F_y=F_1-600{~kN}+400{~kN}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad F_1=200{~kN}
\end{gathered}
\]

We can then calculate the change in length of each pole.

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta L_1 & =\frac{F_1 L_1}{A_1 E_1}=\frac{200000{~N} * 5{~m}}{\pi * (0.015{~in.})^2 * 200 * 10^9\frac{N}{m^2}}=0.00707{~m}=7.07{~mm} \\
\Delta L_2 & =\frac{F_2 L_2}{A_2 E_2}=\frac{400000{~N} * 3{~m}}{\pi * (0.025{~in.})^2 * 70 * 10^9\frac{N}{m^2}}=0.00873{~m}=8.73{~mm}
\end{aligned}
\]

To determine the deflection at point C, first determine that point B has
deflected (8.73 mm -- 7.07 mm) = 1.66 mm more than point A.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.23958in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.4 part 3.png}
\end{center}

We can find how much more point C has deflected than point A by using
similar triangles.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.63542in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.4 part 4.png}
\end{center}

\[
\frac{1.66{~mm}}{12{~m}}=\frac{\Delta L_{C / A}}{4{~m}} \quad\rightarrow\quad \Delta L_{C / A}=0.553{~mm}
\]

So point C deflects 0.553 mm more than point A, which is a total
deflection at point C of

\[
\Delta L_C=7.07{~mm}+0.553{~mm}=7.62{~mm}
\]

\section{Statically Indeterminate Problems}\label{sec-5.5}

Click to expand

A statically indeterminate problem is one which has more unknowns than
we have equilibrium equations to solve for those unknowns. This is an
issue because it prevents us from finding the internal loads and we
therefore can't calculate stress or deformation.

We'll study two types of statically indeterminate problems. In the first
type there will be additional supports beyond those needed to maintain
equilibrium. These are known as redundant supports and they are quite
common in practice (Figure 5.9).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/PNGs/architecture-bridge-suspension-bridge-france-pillar-landmark-759379-pxhere.com.jpg}

}

\caption{Figure 5.9: An example of redundancy on a suspension bridge.
There are multiple supports and multiple cables at each support, such
that if one cable fails the entire structure does not collapse.}

\end{figure}%

In such problems, it is not possible to determine all of the reaction
forces using equilibrium alone. However, we can use our knowledge of
deformation to help. If a member is held between two supports then its
total deformation must be zero. Since the change in length depends on
the internal force in the member, this introduces an additional equation
to use alongside the equilibrium equations. There are two possible
approaches here.

\textbf{Approach 1}: To determine the reaction force at the redundant
support, begin by removing the redundant support from the problem and
determining the deformation that would occur if the support was not
there. Then replace the reaction force at the support, which will cause
the member to deform in the opposite direction (Figure 5.10).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.40625in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Figure 5.11.png}

}

\caption{Figure 5.10: (a) A bar held between two rigid supports. (b) A
free body diagram of the beam reveals that there are two unknowns but
only one equilibrium equation. (c) Removing one of the supports allows
the bar to elongate. (d) Replacing the support force causes the bar to
contract.}

\end{figure}%

The sum of these two deformations must equal the actual deformation of
the member. If the member is held between two rigid supports, the total
deformation will be zero. If there is a small gap or the supports allow
a certain amount of movement, the total deformation will be equal to the
size of this gap. Example 5.5 shows this process applied to a bar made
of 2 materials.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 5.5}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A 15-foot-tall concrete (E = 4,000 ksi) column has a square
cross-section of 6 in. by 6 in. A 10-foot-tall-copper (E = 17,000 ksi)
cylinder with an outer diameter of 4 in. and in inner diameter of 3 in.
is attached to the top of the concrete. The structure is fixed between
two supports. A force of 25 kips is applied as shown. Determine the
average normal stress in each material.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.89583in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.5 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

To determine the internal force in each material, we first need to find
the reaction forces at the supports. We would usually draw a free body
diagram and apply equilibrium equations to find these forces. However,
this won't work here because the problem is statically indeterminate.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.15625in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.5 part 2.png}
\end{center}

\[
\sum F_y=F_1+F_2-25{~kips}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad F_1+F_2=25{~kips}
\]

To solve the statically indeterminate problem, remove one of the
supports and allow the structure to deform. Either support may be
removed. Let's remove the top support. In this scenario there is no load
in the copper cylinder and there is a compressive load of 25 kips in the
concrete column.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.1875in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.5 part 3.png}
\end{center}

The total deformation of the structure in this scenario is:

\[
\Delta L=\sum \frac{F L}{A E}=0-\frac{(25{~kips}) *(15 * 12){~in.}}{(6 * 6){~in.}^2 *(4,000)\frac{kips}{in.^2}}=-0.03125{~in}
\]

Then replace force F\textsubscript{1} and calculate the deformation
caused by this force. Since the force is applied at the top of the
structure, both the concrete and the copper will elongate.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.1875in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.5 part 4.png}
\end{center}

\[
\Delta L=\sum \frac{F L}{A E}=\frac{F_1 *(10 * 12){~in.}}{\pi(2^2-1.5^2){~in.}^2 *(17,000)\frac{kips}{in.^2}}+\frac{\left(F_1\right) *(15 * 12){~in.}}{(6 * 6){~in.}^2 *(4,000)\frac{kips}{in.^2}} \\
=0.001284F_1+0.00125 F_1 \\
=0.002534 F_1
\]

Since the structure is fixed at both ends, the actual total deformation
must be zero.

\[
-0.03125{~in.}+0.002534 F_1=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad F_1=12.3{~kips}
\]

Returning to our equilibrium equation, we can also find force
F\textsubscript{2}.

\[
F_1+F_2=25{~kips} \\
12.3{~kips}+F_2=25{~kips} \\
F_2=12.7{~kips}
\]

The internal force in the copper cylinder will be 12.3 kips and the
internal force in the concrete column will be 12.7 kips. Finally,
calculate the stress in each material. Note from our original free body
diagram that the copper cylinder is in tension while the concrete column
is in compression. We'll introduce a negative sign here to indicate
compressive stress in the concrete.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_{copper}=\frac{N_1}{A_1}=\frac{12.3{~kips}}{\pi(2^2-1.5^2){~in.}^2}=2.24 {~ksi} \\
& \sigma_{concrete}=-\frac{N_2}{A_2}=-\frac{12.7{~kips}}{(6 * 6){~in.}^2}=-0.353 {~ksi}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Approach 2}: An alternate approach is to start by noting that
the total deformation of the bar must be zero. In the case shown in
Figure 5.11, we can say that the deformation of segment 1 plus the
deformation of segment 2 must add up to zero.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/PNGs/Figure 5.12.png}

}

\caption{Figure 5.11: (a) A bar held between two rigid supports. (b) A
free body diagram of the bar.}

\end{figure}%

The internal load in segment 1 is FA and the internal load in segment 2
is FB, so there are currently two unknowns. We may use an equilibrium
equation to solve for these two unknowns simultaneously.

\[
\begin{aligned} & \frac{F_A L_1}{A_1 E_1}+\frac{F_B L_2}{A_2 E_2}=0 \\ & F-F_A-F_B=0\end{aligned}\]

Example 5.6 re-solves Example 5.5 using this method instead.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 5.6}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A 15-foot-tall concrete (E = 4,000 ksi) column has a square

is attached to the top of the concrete. The structure is fixed between
two supports. A force of 25 kips is applied as shown. Determine the
average normal stress in each material.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.94792in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.6 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

As before, begin with an equilibrium equation that relates the support
loads to the applied load. In this equation we use the convention that
forces pointing upwards are positive and forces pointing downwards are
negative.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.26042in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.6 part 2.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sum F_y=F_1+F_2-25{~kips}=0 \\
& F_1+F_2=25{~kips}
\end{aligned}
\]

This bar consists of 2 segments -- the copper cylinder (segment 1) and
the concrete column (segment 2). Since the bar is held between two rigid
supports, the total deformation of these two segments must sum to zero.
Note that in this diagram segment 1 is in tension while segment 2 is in
compression. We must be consistent with the sign convention that tension
is positive and compression is negative.

\[
\frac{F_1 L_1}{A_1 E_1}-\frac{F_2 L_2}{A_2 E_2}=0
\]

Here F1 and F2 are the internal forces in segments 1 and 2 of the bar.
These will be the same as the reaction loads at the supports that we are
trying to solve for.

\[
\frac{F_1 *(10 * 12){~in.}}{\pi(2^2-1.5^2){~in.}^2 *(17,000)\frac{kips}{in.^2}}-\frac{F_2 *(15 * 12){~in.}}{(6 * 6){~in.}^2 *(4,000)\frac{kips}{in.^2}}=0
\]

Rearrange the equilibrium equation and substitute into the deformation
equation.

\[
\begin{gathered}
F_1=25{~kips}-F_2 \\
\frac{(25-F_2){~kips} *(10 * 12){~in.}}{\pi(2^2-1.5^2){~in.}^2 *(17,000)\frac{kips}{in.^2}}-\frac{F_2 *(15 * 12){in.}}{(6 * 6){in.}^2 *(4,000)\frac{kips}{in.^2}}=0
\end{gathered}
\]

Then simplify and solve for force F2.

\[
\begin{gathered}
0.0321-0.001284 F_2-0.00125 F_2=0 \\
0.0321=0.002534 F_2 \\
F_2=12.7 {~kips}
\end{gathered}
\]

Then use the equilibrium equation again to find F1.

\[
F_1=25{~kips}-12.7{~kips}=12.3{~kips}
\]

These are the same reactions that we found in Example 5.5 when we solved
this problem using the other approach. From here we can find the stress
in each material as before, noting again from our diagram that segment 2
is in compression.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_{copper}=\frac{N_1}{A_1}=\frac{12.3{~kips}}{\pi(2^2-1.5^2){~in.}^2}=2.24 {~ksi} \\
& \sigma_{concrete}=-\frac{N_2}{A_2}=-\frac{12.7{~kips}}{(6 * 6){~in.}^2}=-0.353 {~ksi}
\end{aligned}
\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

The second type of indeterminate problem involves two materials bonded
together in parallel. In these problems it's possible to find the
reactions at the supports, but not possible to find the internal force
in each material using only equilibrium (Figure 5.12).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=2.94792in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Figure 5.13.png}

}

\caption{Figure 5.12: When two materials in parallel are subjected to
force F, the force is split between the two materials
(F\textsubscript{1} and F\textsubscript{2}). By equilibrium
F\textsubscript{1} + F\textsubscript{2} = F but this is not sufficient
to find the force in each material.}

\end{figure}%

We have one equilibrium equation but two unknown internal forces.
However, since the materials are bonded together we can say that they
must deform by the same amount. By setting the deformation for each
material equal to each other we can define a second equation that
involves the two internal forces and, combined with the equilibrium
equation, we can now solve for both internal forces. See Example 5.7 for
a demonstration.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 5.7}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A 20-ft-tall concrete (E = 4,000 ksi) column has a square cross-section
6 inches on each side. It is reinforced by six pieces of steel (E =
30,000 ksi) rebar that extend through the length of the column. Each has
a diameter of 0.5 inches. The column is subjected to a compressive load
of 70 kips. Determine the stress in each material.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.84375in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.7 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The 70 kips force will be split between the two materials. We need to
find the force in each material before we can calculate the stress.
Start by cutting a cross-section through the column, drawing a free body
diagram, and writing an equilibrium equation.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.42708in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.7 copy.png}
\end{center}

\[
\sum F_y= F_C+F_S=70{~kips}
\]

This problem is statically indeterminate, since we have two unknowns and
only one equilibrium equation. However, since the two materials are
bonded together we can say that they must both deform the same amount.

\[
\Delta L_C=\Delta L_S
\]

Since we know \(\Delta L=\frac{F L}{A E}\)

\[
\frac{F_C L_C}{A_C E_C}=\frac{F_S L_S}{A_S E_S}
\]

The length of both materials is 20 ft, so this term will cancel.

Although the steel is 6 individual pieces, it's fine to determine the
total area of the steel and the total force in the steel. The total area
of the steel is \(A_S=6 * \pi * (0.25{~in.})^2=1.178{~in}^2\)

For the area of the concrete, calculate the area of the square and then
remove the area of the 6 rebar rods.

\[
A_C=(6 * 6){~in.}^2-1.178{~in.^2}=34.82{~in.}^2
\]

Substitute these into the deformation equation and rearrange.

\[
\begin{gathered}
\frac{F_C}{34.82{~in.}^2 * 4,000{~ksi}}=\frac{F_S}{1.178{~in.}^2 * 30,000{~ksi}} \\
F_C=F_S\left[\frac{34.82{~in.}^2 * 4,000{~ksi}}{1.178{~in.}^2 * 30,000{~ksi}}\right] \\
F_C=3.941 F_S
\end{gathered}
\]

Substitute this into the equilibrium equation.

\[
\begin{aligned}
&F_C+F_S=70{~kips} \\
&3.941 F_S+F_S=70{~kips} \\
&4.941 F_S=70{~kips} \\
&F_S=14.2{~kips}
\end{aligned}
\]

Then since
\(F_C=3.941 F_S \quad\rightarrow\quad F_C=3.941 * 14.2{~kips}=55.8{~kips}\)

Now that we know the force in each material, we can calculate the stress
in each material.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_S=\frac{14.2{~kips}}{1.178{~in.}^2}=12.0{~ksi} \\
& \sigma_C=\frac{55.8{~kips}}{34.82{~in.}^2}=1.60{~ksi}
\end{aligned}
\]

  Write out equilibrium equations. There will be too many unknowns, so
  put these to one side for now.
\item
  Remove one of the supports and calculate the amount of deformation

  \(\Delta L_1=\sum \frac{F L}{A E}\)

\item
  Write an equation saying that the total deformation in each segment of
  the bar must sum to the total deformation of the bar (zero if the bar
  is held between two rigid supports). A new segment must be made any

\section{Thermal Deformation}\label{sec-5.6}

Click to expand

So far, we've studied the effects of axial forces on an object and how
they create stresses and deformations. Temperature changes will also
cause an object to deform. The strain due to temperature can be
predicted by:

\[
\varepsilon_T=\alpha \Delta T\]

where

\emph{𝜀\textsubscript{T} = Thermal strain}

\emph{𝛼 = Coefficient of thermal expansion}
\(\left[\frac{1}{{ }^{\circ} C}, \frac{1}{{ }^{\circ} F}\right]\)

\emph{ΔT = Change in temperature}
\(\left[{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C},{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right]\)

As before, strain is dimensionless. The coefficient of thermal expansion
is a material constant that can be looked up in handbooks or in Appendix
C. Note that for a given change in temperature, the thermal strain will
be the same in the axial and transverse directions.

Since strain is also defined as \(\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta L}{L}\), we
can also predict the deformation due to a change in temperature:

\[
\varepsilon_T=\alpha \Delta T=\frac{\Delta L}{L} \rightarrow \Delta L=\alpha \Delta T L\]

If the object is free to expand or contract this doesn't cause any
issues and is easy to account for. Many real applications will include a
small gap to allow for changes in length due to temperature changes
(Figure 5.13). It is even possible that an object is subjected to both a
physical force and a temperature change and the total change in length
is simply the sum of these effects:

\[
\Delta L=\Delta L_F+\Delta L_T=\frac{F L}{A E}+\alpha \Delta T L\]

\strut \\

\textbf{Figure 5.13} -- Expansion joint on a bridge, allowing for
thermal expansion and contraction of the bridge as temperature changes
through the year.

However if we do not design a gap, or if the gap is not large enough,
then the object is not free to expand or contract. As the member pushes
or pulls on its supports, a physical force is created. This in turn
creates a stress in the object and these stresses can be very large.
Such problems are statically indeterminate as the force applied on the
member by the support is unknown and can't be found using only
equilibrium. Solving these problems is very similar to solving the first
type of statically indeterminate problem. First, remove a support and
determine the amount of deformation that would occur due to the change
in temperature if the object were free to deform. Then replace the force
from the removed support, which will cause the object to deform in the
other direction. The sum of these two deformations will equal the total
deformation of the member as before. Example 5.8 works through an
indeterminate thermal expansion problem.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 5.8: Indeterminate thermal expansion without gap.

Steel (E = 200 GPa, α = 11.7 x 10-6 /°C) train rails are laid
end-to-end. Each rail is 20 meters long. A small section of this track
is shown below. The rails are laid in winter when the temperature is 0°
C. In summer, the maximum temperature is 40°C. Determine the compressive
stress in the rail as a result of the temperature change if:

(a) In a particular section of track, the rails are laid with no gap
between them.

(b) In another section, the rails have a 5-mm-gap between them.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.33333in,height=\textheight]{images/PNGs/Example 5.8.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

(a)

First determine the deformation of each rail that would occur if it was
free to expand.

\[
\Delta L_T=\alpha \Delta T L=11.7 \times 10^{-6}/^\circ{C} * 40^\circ{C} * 20{~m}=0.00936{~m}
\]

Since each rail will contact the rail next to it as it tries to expand,
each rail will experience a compressive force. This force causes
compression in the rail.

\[
\Delta L=-\frac{F L}{A E}
\]

The actual deformation of each rail must be zero since they are in
contact end-to-end. Thus, these deformations must sum to zero.

\[
0.00936{~m}-\frac{F * 20{~m}}{A * 200 * 10^9{~Pa}}=0
\]

Although we don't know the cross-sectional area of the rail, we can
replace \(\sigma=\frac{F}{A}\)

\[
\begin{gathered}
0.00936{~m}-\sigma * \frac{20{~m}}{200 * 10^9{~Pa}}=0 \\
\sigma=\frac{0.00936{~m} * 200 * 10^9{~Pa}}{20{~m}}=93.6{~MPa}
\end{gathered}
\]

(b)

In this case we again begin by determining the deformation of each rail
that would occur if it was free to expand.

\[
\Delta L_T=\alpha \Delta T L=11.7 \times 10^{-6}/^\circ{C} * 40^\circ{C} * 20{~m}=0.00936{~m}
\]

Each rail would expand 9.36 mm, but the gap between rails is only 5 mm
so the rails close this gap and make contact, which means there will
again be some compressive stress. Set up the deformation equation as in
part (a), but this time the deformation is 5 mm (0.005 m) instead of
zero.

\[
0.00936{~m}-\frac{F * 20{~m}}{A * 200 * 10^9{~Pa}}=0.005{~m}
\]

Replace \(\sigma=\frac{F}{A}\) as before and determine the stress.

\[
\begin{gathered}
0.00936{~m}-\sigma * \frac{20{~m}}{200 * 10^9{~Pa}}=0.005{~m} \\
0.00936{~m}-0.005{~m}=\sigma * \frac{20{~m}}{200 * 10^9{~Pa}} \\
\sigma=\frac{0.00436{~m} * 200 * 10^9{~Pa}}{20{~m}}=43.6{~MPa}
\end{gathered}
\]

We can see that installing the rails with a small gap has significantly
reduced the thermal stress. Accurately predicting the amount of
deformation and leaving a suitably sized gap would reduce the stress
even further.

Axial loads cause normal stresses. While we generally calculate the
average normal stress, stress concentrations occur close to applied
loads, supports, and changes in geometry.

These stress concentrations can be large and cause localized failure
even if the average stress is within acceptable limits. Modeling stress
concentration is beyond the scope of this course, but we can determine
maximum stresses for different geometries using stress concentration
curves.

It is often desirable to limit the total change in length of a bar
subjected to axial loads. Change in length can be predicted directly.

In practice, it is useful to leave a gap to allow for change in length.
If a change in length is prevented from happening, this creates a stress
in the bar.

Changes in temperature will also cause axial deformation of a bar, known
as thermal deformation. Thermal deformation can lead to a physical
stress in the bar if the deformation is prevented from occurring by a
support.

Torsion is a moment applied around the longitudinal axis of a body. The
effect of torsion is a twisting action. Torsion is found in many common
situations. Some examples of applications in which torsion is a primary
form of loading include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In machinery, rotating shafts, such as transmission shafts that
  transmit power, are subjected to torque
\item
  When one uses a torque wrench to tight or loosen a bolt, the bolt is
  subjected to torque
\item
  Poles on which road signs and traffic lights are mounted are subjected
  to torque when forces (such as wind) are applied perpendicular to the
  sign.
\item
  Hinge pins are subjected to torque when the rotating elements they are
  attached to (doors for example) are rotated.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Figure 6.1:} needs caption

This chapter will focus on bodies subjected to pure torsion (no axial or
bending loads). These concepts will appear again in chapter 12 when more
generalized loading conditions are discussed.

\subsection{The Effect of Torsion}\label{the-effect-of-torsion}

As mentioned above, the effect of a torsional moment is to cause the
body to twist. The resulting stress is a shear stress.

Consider the pleated tube shown in figure 6.1 (a) and (b) below. Figure
6.1(a) shows the tube in an unloaded state with some of the pleats
colored for identification. In figure 6.1(b), we see that after a torque
is applied, the pleats move vertically but not horizontally. In
addition, without the color present, it would be difficult to identify
the displacement at all. We can say that all points remain in their
original plane even in the deformed state so that the shape of the
cross-section is unchanged.

\textbf{Figure 6.2:} Unloaded tube (a) and tube with torque applied (b).

Now consider the I-beam subjected to torsion in figure 6.2. In this case
we see that the shape of the cross-section changes and that the points
do not remain in the same vertical plane (there is horizontal
displacement as well as vertical). This shape change is referred to as
warping. In this text, we will only be considering circular
cross-sections with no warping.

\textbf{Figure 6.3:} I-beam subjected to torsion unloaded (a) and with
applied torque (b).

Going back to figure 6.1, let's consider the shape formed by the
non-displaced colored lines in figure 6.1(a) versus the displaced lines
in figure 6.1(b). These images are shown again in figure 6.3. In the
non-displaced case, a rectangle can be drawn around the green lines on
the left with 90° corners. In the displaced case, the corners are no
longer at 90°. From chapter 2, we know that this change in angle is the
definition of shear strain. The evidence of shear strain indicates that
the applied torque results in shear stress. In section 6.2, the equation
that relates torque to shear stress will be derived.

\textbf{Figure 6.4:} Evidence of shear strain

\subsection{Determination of Internal
Torques}\label{determination-of-internal-torques}

As with axial loading, the stress and deformations due to torsion vary
from point to point within a body and are dependent on the internal
torques at the individual points and geometric section properties.
Internal torques can be found by sectioning bodies and applying
equilibrium in a process also very similar as was done in the axial
loading problems (see example 1.5 in chapter 1 and also examples 2.1 and
2.2 in chapter 2). In the case of internal torques, moment equilibrium
around the longitudinal axis will be applied instead of force summation.

Before looking at an example that illustrates the process of finding
internal torque reactions, it would be beneficial to establish the sign
conventions that will be used as well as ways of representing torque in
this text.

\subsection{Sign Convention and Representation of
Torque}\label{sign-convention-and-representation-of-torque}

Just as is typically used for moments, the sign convention that will be
used in this text for torques is to assign a positive sign to torques
that are counterclockwise and a negative sign for those that are
clockwise. However, the direction that a torque appears to be depends on
the perspective from which the rotation is being observed. In figure 6.1
below, the applied torque would appear clockwise if viewed from the left
end of the bar towards the right and counterclockwise if viewed from the
right end of the bar towards the left. As long as one is being
consistent, it is not usually important which perspective is used.
However, a typical convention is to look from the free end of the shaft
if there is one, towards the fixed end, or from the positive
longitudinal axis if one is given, towards the negative.

\textbf{Figure 6.5:} Different directions for viewing torque result in
different perspectives on sign.

It can sometimes be difficult to visually determine whether a torque
appears clockwise or counterclockwise, so one tool that can be used is
the right-hand rule. If you use your right hand and curl your fingers in
the direction of the rotation represented by the torque arrow, a
positive (counterclockwise) torque would be represented if your thumb
points in the direction of the positive longitudinal axis (the x-axis in
figure 6.2).

\textbf{Figure 6.6:} Using the right-hand rule to determine sign for
torque

When examining cut sections as will be needed to determine internal
torques, establishing the sign of the internal torque requires looking
from the direction of the cut edge towards the end of the cut section.
One tool that can be used in this instance in place of direction
visualization is to make the cut necessary to determine the internal
torque in a given section and then imagine your right hand as being at
the cut edge and curl your fingers in the direction of the torque. If
your thumb points away from the cut edge, the internal torque is
positive and vice versa. This is illustrated in figure 6.3.

\textbf{Figure 6.7:} Tool to determine sign of internal torques

Finally, since circular arrows can be difficult to draw in a way that
clearly conveys direction, double headed line arrows are frequently used
to represent torque. Conventions can vary between texts and other
sources. In this text, the following convention will be used:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  On a whole body FBD, arrows facing in the direction of the positive
  longitudinal axis will be considered to indicate positive torques
  (counterclockwise) and vice versa. When applying equilibrium, these
  signs will be used.
\item
  The same will hold true for cut section FBD's used to determine
  internal torques. However, if applying equilibrium indicates that the
  internal torque points away from the cut section, the torque can be
  concluded to be positive (counterclockwise) for the purposes of
  calculating angle of twist (as discussed in section 6.3). Internal
  torque that points towards the cut section can be concluded to be
  negative (clockwise). In addition, on the cut sections, the regular
  convention of right directed arrows being positive and left directed
  arrows being negative for the purpose of summing moments will be used.
\end{enumerate}

The direction of the internal torque is not important in calculating
shear stress (the sign on the stress requires concepts that will be
discussed in chapter 12), but it is important when calculating angle of
twist (section 6.3).

Example 6.1 demonstrates how to determine internal torques in a
multi-section body as well as how to apply the above-described sign
conventions.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 6.1}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A multi-section steel bar is supported by a fixed support at A and is
subjected to torque T\textsubscript{B} = 70 N mm and T\textsubscript{E}
= 30 N mm. Determine the internal torque at all points in the shaft.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Since the loading consists of torques applied at two distinct points,
the internal torque will be constant in the sections to the left and
right of where the torques are applied. Therefore, the problem reduces
down to determining the internal torque between A and B and the internal
torque between B and E. Note that because A is a fixed support, there
will be an additional torque (the reaction torque) there that can be
determined by applying equilibrium to the whole shaft if necessary. In
this particular example, we will discuss why the reaction force is not
necessary to calculate the internal torques.~

To determine the internal torque in section AB, we can cut the shaft
anywhere between points A and B and draw an FBD of the section to the
left of the cut (everything from point A to the cut) or the section to
the right of the cut (everything from the cut to E). An illustration of
the cut and the resulting FBD's are shown below. Note that the internal
torque T\textsubscript{AB} is drawn in opposite directions on the two
sections. This must be the case if the bar is in equilibrium.

{[}figure{]}

Before applying equilibrium, note the double headed arrows that
represent the torques and the significance of the directions. In the
above diagrams T\textsubscript{AB} is drawn as \textbf{positive}
internal torque on both the left and right section diagrams
\textbf{since it points away from the cut} in both instances. However,
when summing moments (as shown below), the direction of the arrow will
be used as the sign in the equilibrium equation.

For the applied loads, since T\textsubscript{A} is drawn in the negative
x direction on the left side cut section, it is assumed to be negative
(or look clockwise as viewed in the direction of E towards A). On the
right side diagram, T\textsubscript{B} is drawn in the positive x
direction since it appears counterclockwise as viewed from E towards A.
Applied torque T\textsubscript{E} is drawn in the negative direction
since it appears clockwise as viewed in the direction of E towards A.

Since writing equilibrium equations based on the FBD of the left side
section would require first determining the reaction torque at wall A,
we will choose to use the FBD of the section to the right of the cut
instead.

Recall that torques are moments that cause the body to twist. In this
problem the torques act around the x-axis. Applying the moment
equilibrium equation on this section gives:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sum M_x=-T_{A B}+T_B-T_E=0 \\
\sum M_x=-T_{A B}+70 \mathrm{Nmm}-30 \mathrm{Nmm}=0 \\
T_{A B}=40 \mathrm{Nmm}
\end{gathered}
\]

The positive result confirms that the assumed direction for
T\textsubscript{AB} is the correct one, so it is a counterclockwise
torque since it points away from the cut. The same result would have
been obtained by applying equilibrium to the left side section after
determining T\textsubscript{A}.

Similarly, the internal torque in all parts of the shaft between B and E
can be determined by cutting the shaft at a non-specific point between B
and E and applying equilibrium to the section of shaft to the left of
the cut or the section to the right of the cut. The two FBD's are shown
below. Once again, the internal torque (T\textsubscript{BE} in this
case) is drawn in the direction away from the cut on both sections, so
it is assumed to be positive on both sections.

{[}figure{]}

Applying the moment equilibrium equation on the right section gives:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sum M_x=-T_{B E}-T_E=0 \\
& \sum M_x=-T_{B E}-30 N \mathrm{~mm}=0 \\
& T_{B E}=-30 \mathrm{Nmm}
\end{aligned}
\]

The negative result indicates that TBE goes in the opposite direction
than what is drawn, so it points towards the cut section and is
clockwise.

\textbf{The internal torque for all points between A and B is 40 N mm
counterclockwise.}

\textbf{The internal torque for all points between B and E is 30 N mm
clockwise.}

\section{Calculation of Shear Stress due to Pure Torsion}\label{sec-6.1}

Click to expand

In this section, the derivation of the shear stress equation for torque
is explained before presenting it so that the inputs to the resulting
equation, as well as the assumptions, etc., can be better understood.

Consider a circular shaft that is fixed on one end and subjected to
torque on the free end, as shown in figure 6.1.1. The shaft has an outer
radius, c, as shown in figure 6.1.2 (b). For the given loading, the
internal torque at any location along the shaft, x, would also be T.

\textbf{Figure 6.8:} Illustration of fixed end shaft subjected to torque
and smaller sliver within the shaft.

Before the torque, T, is applied, a horizontal line segment drawn across
a sliver of the shaft, marked by points A and B, has a length of Δx. Now
let's consider the same shaft segment after the torque has been applied
and points A and B move to A' and B'. An illustration of the resulting
geometry can be seen in figure 6.1.2 (a). Since the shaft is fixed on
the left end, we see that point B on the shaft will rotate more than
point A. We can approximate that line segment AB remains linear for a
very narrow section of shaft (infinitely small Δx).

\textbf{Figure 6.9:} Illustration of the displacement of points A and B
on the shaft (a) and the cross-section of the shaft (b).

Recalling that shear strain is the change in the angle between two lines
that are originally perpendicular, we can see that the angle of tilt in
AB after the torque is applied is the shear strain, γ, that results from
the torque. The displacement of point B from the original position to B'
on the cross-section is shown in figure 6.1.2 (b). For an infinitely
small Δx, the arc segment from B to B' can be approximated as vertical
so that the shear strain γ can be expressed using trigonometry as:

\[
\tan (\gamma)=\frac{B B^{\prime}}{\Delta x}
\]

The small angle approximation (again, based on an infinitely small Δx),
gives:

\[
\gamma=\frac{B B^{\prime}}{\Delta x}
\]

Now consider the cross-section of the shaft where point B and B' are
located, shown in figure 6.1.2b. As discussed above, B' is the location
point B moves to when the torque is applied, so the angle between the
radial lines that go from the center to points B and B', respectively,
of the shaft segment is the angle of twist of the segment. Since we are
considering just a section of the shaft, the angle is represented as Δφ
(as opposed to the absolute angle of twist, φ, as measured from the
fixed end). If the outer radius of the shaft is r = c, then the length
of BB' is given by the arclength, so:

\[
\mathrm{BB}^{\prime}=\mathrm{c}(\Delta \varphi)
\]

and

\[
\gamma=\frac{c(\Delta \varphi)}{\Delta x}
\]

Generalizing this result for any point on the cross-section that is
located at an arbitrary radial distance ρ from the center gives:

\[
\gamma=\frac{\rho(\Delta \varphi)}{\Delta x}
\]

The resulting expression of γ shows that the shear strain varies
linearly with ρ from the center of the cross-section to the outer
radius, as illustrated in figure 6.1.3. The shear strain is 0 at the
center, and the max shear strain occurs at the max value of ρ = c.

\[
\gamma_{\max }=\frac{c(\Delta \varphi)}{\Delta x}
\]

Substituting the general and max expressions for shear strain into
Hooke's Law for shear stress, τ = Gγ, reveals that shear stress also
varies linearly from 0 to τ\textsubscript{max} in going from the center
of the cross-section to the outer radius.

\[
\tau=G \gamma=G \frac{\rho(\Delta \varphi)}{\Delta x}, \tau_{\max }=G \frac{c(\Delta \varphi)}{\Delta x}
\]

\textbf{Figure 6.10:} Shear strain and shear stress vary linearly from
the center to the outer edge of the circular cross-section.

Looking at figure 6.1.3 shows that the slope of the linear variation is
\(\frac{\tau_{\max }}{c}\) and the shear stress can also be expressed
as:

\[
\tau=\frac{\tau_{\max }}{c} \rho\quad(6.1)
\]

The last step in developing the shear stress relationship to torque
involves considering the equilibrium of the shaft. Refer to figure
6.1.4. If each point (i) on the cross-section with area
dA\textsubscript{i} has a given amount of shear
stress,τ\textsubscript{i}, given by equation 6.1.1, then the
corresponding force at each point dF\textsubscript{i} can be calculated
as:

\[
\mathrm{dF}_i=\tau_i \mathrm{dA}_i=\frac{\tau_{\max }}{c} \rho_i d A\quad(6.2)
\]

\textbf{Figure 6.11:} Illustration of infinitesimal forces on the shaft
cross-section.

Recalling that the internal torque everywhere on the shaft is T,
equilibrium dictates that the sum of the moments about the center of the
cross-section should be equal to T. For an infinite number of points on
the cross-section, this summation can be performed as an integral:

\[
T=\int d F_i \rho_i=\int \frac{\tau_{\max }}{c} \rho_i^2 d A\quad(6.3)
\]

Since τ\textsubscript{max} and c are constant, they can be pulled
outside the integral, leaving the integral portion to be
\(\int \rho_i^2 d A\), which is the definition of the polar moment of
inertia. The polar moment of inertia is the moment of inertia around the
out of plane axis, which is the x-axis. The polar moment of inertia will
be denoted with the letter J in this text.

For a solid circular cross-section of outer radius, r, and outer
diameter, d:

\[
J_{\text {solid }}=\frac{\pi}{4} r^4=\frac{\pi}{64} d^4
\]

For a tube or hollow circular cross-section with outer radius and
diameter, r\textsubscript{o} and d\textsubscript{o}, respectively, and
inner radius and diameter, r\textsubscript{i} and d\textsubscript{i},
respectively:

\[
J_{\text {hollow }}=\frac{\pi}{4}\left(r_o^4-r_i^4\right)=\frac{\pi}{32}\left(d_o^4-d_i^4\right)
\]

Equation 6.3 can be simplified to:

\[
T=\frac{\tau_{\max } J}{c}\quad(6.4)
\]

Solving equation 6.4 for τ\textsubscript{max} gives:

\[
\tau_{\max }=\frac{T c}{J} \quad(6.5)
\]

Solving equation 6.2.1 for τ\textsubscript{max} and substituting the
resulting expression into equation 6.2.5 gives a more general form of
the equation:

\[
\tau=\frac{T \rho}{J} \quad(6.6)
\]

Keep in mind that the ``max'' designation in equation 6.5 is referring
to the max shear stress with respect to the variation across the surface
of the cross-section.

Note that for now, only the magnitude of the shear stress (without sign)
will be determined since the sign for shear stress is not based purely
on the sign of the torque. The sign on shear stress will be discussed in
chapter 12.

Example 6.2 demonstrates the use of the above equations to determine
shear stress in the same circular bar assembly used in example 6.1.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 6.2}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The multi-section solid steel bar of example 6.1 is repeated here with
the same loading (TB = 70 N mm and TE = 30 N mm). Also, given the
diameters: dAC = 50 mm, dCD = 20 mm, and dDE = 35 mm, determine the
magnitude and location of the max shear stress in the bar assembly.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

It can be seen from equation 6.5 that the max shear stress will depend
on the internal torque and the geometrical properties of the shaft.
Therefore, to find the max shear stress, we must calculate the shear
stress at the outer radius for each distinct section of the shaft for
which the internal torque and/or cross-sectional dimensions change. Each
segment of the bar for which the internal torque stays constant, and the
cross-sectional dimensions stay constant will have constant shear
stress. In this example, there are 4 distinct sections for which to
calculate shear stress:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Section AB which gets sectioned at B due to the applied torque
\item
  Section BC which gets sectioned at C due to the geometry change at C
\item
  Section CD which gets sectioned at D due to the geometry change at D
\item
  Section DE which would get sectioned at E if E were not the end of the
  shaft
\end{enumerate}

From example 6.1, it is known that the magnitudes of the internal torque
for all points between A and B, TAB, is 40 N mm and the internal torque
for all points between B and E, TBE, is 70 N mm. Since the internal
torque stays constant from B to E, it is known that TBC = TCD = TDE = 70
N mm. Recall that only the \textbf{magnitude} of shear stress will be
calculated with the sign being discussed in chapter 12.

Since the bar has a solid cross-section with the diameters given, we
will use \(J_{\text {solid }}=\frac{\pi}{32} d^4\) to calculate the
polar moment of inertia at each section.

Applying equation 6.5 to each section:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\tau_{A B}=\frac{T_{A B} * c_{A B}}{J_{A B}}=\frac{0.04 N \cdot m * \frac{0.05}{2} m} {\frac{\pi}{32}(0.05 m)^4}=1629.7 \mathrm{~Pa}=1.630 \mathrm{kPa} \\
\\
\tau_{B C}=\frac{T_{B C} * c_{B C}}{J_{B C}}=\frac{0.07 \mathrm{~N} \cdot m * \frac{0.05}{2} m}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.05 \mathrm{~m})^4}=2852 \mathrm{~Pa}=2.85 \mathrm{kPa} \\
\\
\tau_{C D}=\frac{T_{C D} * c_{C D}}{J_{C D}}=\frac{0.07 \mathrm{~N} \cdot m * \frac{0.02}{2} m}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.02 m)^4}=44563 \mathrm{~Pa}=44.6 \mathrm{kPa} \\
\\
\tau_{D E}=\frac{T_{D E} * c_{D E}}{J_{D E}}=\frac{0.07 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m} * \frac{0.035}{2} m}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.035 \mathrm{~m})^4}=8315 \mathrm{MPa}=8.32 \mathrm{kPa}
\end{gathered}
\]

\textbf{The max shear stress in the bar is 44.6 kPa and occurs in
section CD.}

\section{Calculation of Angle of Twist}\label{sec-6.2}

Click to expand

In chapter 5, we derived and applied a formula for axial deformation. We
will do something similar in this chapter for circular shafts subjected
to torsion. The deformation of a shaft that arises from applying
torsion, assuming deformation is restricted to the elastic deformation
range for the material, is quantified by the angle of twist, φ. As
discussed in section 6.1, and illustrated here again in figure 6.2.1,
the angle of twist is the angle formed between the radial line that goes
from the center of the cross section to a point in its original location
and the radial line that goes from the center to the point in its new
location after the torsional load is applied. The equation to determine
angle of twist at various points along the shaft will be derived below.

\textbf{Figure 6.12:} The angle between B (original location) and B'
(where B moves to after torque is applied to the shaft) is the angle of
twist, φ.

Recall from section 6.1 that the shear strain
\(\gamma=\frac{\rho(\Delta \varphi)}{\Delta x}\). Also recall that Δx
represents the length of a section of shaft of arbitrary length and Δφ
is the change in angle of twist that occurs across that length. For an
infinitely small section of shaft, the shear strain equation can be
expressed in terms of differentials:
\(\gamma=\frac{\rho(d \varphi)}{d x}\).

Now applying Hooke's Law, τ = Gγ, and the equation for shear stress
(equation 6.6) we get:

\[
\frac{\rho(d \varphi)}{d x}=\frac{\tau}{G}=\frac{T \rho}{J G}
\]

Solving for dφ gives:

\[
d \varphi=\frac{T d x}{J G}
\]

For a section (i) of shaft of length L\textsubscript{i} for which torque
(T\textsubscript{i}), material (G\textsubscript{i}), and geometry
(J\textsubscript{i}), stay constant, equation 6.2.1 becomes:

\[
\varphi_i=\frac{T_i L_i}{J_i G_i}
\]

Integrating both sides of equation 6.2.1 gives the total angle of twist
for an entire shaft or section of shaft:

\[
\varphi=\int \frac{T d x}{J G}
\]

For multi-section bodies where each individual section has constant T,
J, and G, the integral can be expressed in the form of a sum where the
angle of twist of each distinct section is calculated individually and
then they are all added together:

\[
\varphi=\varphi_i=\sum \frac{T_i L_i}{J_i G_i}
\]

In these calculations, the sign of internal torque will be important as
it indicates the direction of the twist. If one section twists in one
direction and the adjoining section twists in the opposite direction,
the effect will be that the angles will subtract from each other
resulting in a smaller overall angle of twist. On the other hand, if two
adjoining sections twist in the same direction, the effect will be
additive. According to the assigned sign convention discussed in section
6.1, an overall positive angle of twist indicates that the shaft twists
counterclockwise when looking from the positive end of the longitudinal
axis to the negative and vice versa.

\subsection{Units}\label{units}

If values for T, L, J, and G are substituted in equation 6.2.2 such that
the units are all consistent with each other, the overall unit works out
to be unitless as is expected for an angle calculation. Since the
calculation is for an angle, the actual unit is considered to be
radians. If an angle is desired to be in degrees, the result of the
equation would need to be converted by multiplying the result by π/180.

Because the angle of twist often works out to be very small, it may be
desired to express the value in terms of μrad, which is
10\textsuperscript{-6} radians. To convert from rad to μrad, multiply
the number of radians by 10\textsuperscript{6}.

\subsection{Notation}\label{notation}

When finding the angle of twist, the angle at any given point along the
length of the shaft will be found relative to some reference point.
Often the reference point is a fixed point (at a fixed support for
example), so the relative angle is an absolute angle. In this case, the
symbol φ will be subscripted with the point along the shaft where the
angle was calculated. For example, given the shaft assembly in figure
6.2.2 below, the notation φ\textsubscript{B} denotes the angle of twist
at point B relative to the fixed point A.

If one is finding the relative angle of twist between two non-fixed
points that are on the same section of shaft (same T, J, and G), the
angle of one point relative to another on the same section of shaft is
notated with two subscripts specifying the two points. For example, the
angle of twist of D relative to C in figure 6.2.2 is notated as
φ\textsubscript{CD}. In this case, one would perform the calculation for
the angle of twist at D as if point C is fixed, in which case:

\[
\varphi_{B C}=\frac{T_{C D} L_{C D}}{J_{C D} G_{C D}}
\]

If one is finding the relative angle of twist between two non-fixed
points (let's say B and D in figure 6.2.2) that are on different
sections of shaft (i.e., there are 1 or more section changes between
them due to changing T, J, or G), the relative angle of twist between
them would be found by summing the angles of twist of each section
between them. In this case, the notation would be φ\textsubscript{D/B}
which is said as the angle of twist of D relative to B. If point C is
where the section change occurs, the calculation would be:

\[
\varphi_{D / B}=\varphi_{B C}+\varphi_{C D}
\]

\textbf{Figure 6.13:} A multi-section body with fixed end A and constant
torque conditions in sections

These concepts will be illustrated in example 6.3 which continues with
the same bar assembly and loading used in examples 6.1 and 6.2.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 6.3}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The multi-section steel bar of examples 6.1 and 6.2 is repeated here
with the same loading (T\textsubscript{B} = 70 N mm and
T\textsubscript{E}= 30 N mm). Given the diameters: d\textsubscript{AC} =
50 mm, d\textsubscript{CD} = 20 mm, and d\textsubscript{DE} = 35 mm, and
section lengths L\textsubscript{AB} = 300 mm, L\textsubscript{BC} = 200
mm, L\textsubscript{CD} = 400 mm, and L\textsubscript{DE} = 700 mm,
determine the angle of twist of points C, D, and E, all relative to
point A which is attached to the fixed support. All sections have a
shear modulus of G = 40 GPa. A negative result indicates a clockwise
twist and a positive result indicates a counterclockwise twist.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

As was the case when calculating shear stress in Example 6.2, the
changes in torque and geometry result in 4 distinct sections for which
the angle of twist will remain constant within the section but change
going from one section to another. These sections are AB, BC, CD, and
DE.

In example 6.1, it was shown that the internal torque in section AB is
counterclockwise and equal to 40 N mm. It was also shown that the
internal torque in all sections between B and E is clockwise and equal
to 30 N mm. The directions in this case are relative to viewing in the
direction from the positive end of the x-axis to the negative (i.e.,
point E to point A). This will mean that the angle of twist in section
AB will be positive while the angle of twist in BC, CD, and DE will be
negative.

Since point A is a fixed point,
\(\varphi_{B / A}=\varphi_B=\varphi_{A B}\).

\[
\varphi_B=\varphi_{A B}=\frac{T_{A B} L_{A B}}{J_{A B} G_{A B}}=\frac{0.04 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}(0.300 \mathrm{~m})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.05 \mathrm{~m})^4\left(40 \times 10^9 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}^2}\right)}=4.889 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{rad}
\]

To find the angle of twist of point C relative to A, φC, we will need to
add the angle of twist of section BC to that of section AB:

\[
\varphi_C=\varphi_{A B}+\varphi_{B C}=9.778 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{rad}+\frac{T_{B C} L_{B C}}{J_{B C} G_{B C}}=9.778 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{rad}+\frac{-0.07 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}(0.200 \mathrm{~m})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.05 \mathrm{~m})^4\left(40 \times 10^9 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}^2}\right)}=-8.149 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{rad}
\]

Note that TBC was substituted in as a negative value as discussed above.

To find the angle of twist of point D relative A, φD, the angle of twist
of section CD will be added to the that of AB and BC.

\[
\varphi_D=\varphi_{A B}+\varphi_{B C}+\varphi_{C D}=-1.630 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{rad}+\frac{T_{C D} L_{C D}}{J_{C D} G_{C D}}=-1.630 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{rad}+\frac{-0.07 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}(0.400 \mathrm{~m})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.02 \mathrm{~m})^4\left(40 \times 10^9 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}^2}\right)}=-4.464 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{rad}
\]

Finally, to find the angle of twist of E relative to A, φE, the angle of
twist of section DE will be added to that of AB, BC, and CD.

\[
\varphi_E=\varphi_{A B}+\varphi_{B C}+\varphi_{C D}+\varphi_{D E}=-8.929 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{rad}+\frac{T_{D E} L_{D E}}{J_{D E} G_{D E}}=-8.929 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{rad}+\frac{-0.07 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}(0.700 \mathrm{~m})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.035 \mathrm{~m})^4\left(40 \times 10^9 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}^2}\right)}=-5.296 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{rad}
\]

\textbf{φB = 4.89 x 10-7 rad = .489 μrad (counterclockwise)}

\textbf{φC = -8.149 x 10-8 rad = .0815 μrad (clockwise)}

\textbf{φD = -4.46 x 10-5 rad = 44.6 μrad (clockwise)}

\textbf{φE = -5.30 x 10-5 rad = 53.0 μrad (clockwise)}

\section{Statically Indeterminate Torsion}\label{sec-6.3}

Click to expand

As was discussed in section 5.5 of chapter 5 for axial loading, one may
sometimes encounter loading and constraint conditions that are
statically indeterminate. In these situations, though a structure may be
in static equilibrium, equilibrium equations do not provide enough
equations to solve for all the unknown reactions. In many cases, the
known constraints on deformation can be used to provide the additional
necessary equations. As was discussed for axial loading in 5.5, the two
categories of statically indeterminate loading that will be considered
are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Redundant supports---this would be if there are more than one fixed
  supports or if there are more than two simple supports. In the context
  of torsional loading, we will consider the case of having structures
  or assemblies that are attached to fix supports on either end. In this
  configuration, the shaft is constrained on both ends such that the
  overall angle of twist must be 0 if both ends are truly fixed, or the
  angle of twist is limited to a specified amount if there is a fixed
  degree of freedom on one end (for example if one side involves a loose
  connection).
\item
  Co-axial or parallel shafts---multiple shafts are bonded
  concentrically (one within another) so that they are constrained to
  twist as a unit by the same amount. In this case, the extra equation
  needed in addition to equilibrium comes from setting the angle of
  twist for each material equal to each other.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Step-by-step: Statically Indeterminate Structures}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Draw the FBD of the whole body and apply whichever equilibrium
  equations are relevant given the loading and geometry of the problem.
  For the pure torsion problems of this chapter, only the moment
  equilibrium about the longitudinal axis will be useful. All other
  equilibrium equations will be identically 0.
\item
  Write the equation of kinematic constraint, or the equation that
  expresses the restriction on the deformation. These equations would
  generally be:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \(\sum \varphi=0\) if a shaft assembly is tightly supported by fixed
    supports on the ends.
  \item
    \(\sum \varphi=\text{angle}\) if shaft assembly is supported by
    fixed supports on both ends but one is loose, misaligned, etc. such
    that there is some degree of freedom for the end to twist
  \item
    φ\textsubscript{1} = φ\textsubscript{2}, where 1 and 2 represent two
    different shafts that are bonded together, with one around the
    other.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Write the compatibility equation by substituting the appropriate
  torque twist relationship (\(\varphi=\frac{T L}{J G}\)) into the
  kinematic constraint equation.
\item
  By this point, you should have the same number of equations as
  unknowns. Solve the equations.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Method of Superposition}\label{method-of-superposition}

For the case of redundant supports, an alternative would be to use the
method of superposition. The method of superposition is based on the
idea that the effects of individual loads on the deformation of a body
can be calculated individually and then added together to get the total
effect. To apply this method:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Take away one of the redundant supports
\item
  Determine the total angle of twist of the shaft without the support
\item
  Replace the support but take way the other loads
\item
  Determine the deformation in the shaft due to the reaction at the now
  replaced support
\item
  Sum the angle of twist from step 2 and step 4 and set the total equal
  to zero (or a given angle as appropriate).
\item
  Solve the equation resulting from step 5 for the reaction at the
  redundant support and then use the whole body equilibrium to solve for
  the reaction at the other support(s).
\end{enumerate}

Example 6.4 goes through the process of solving a statically
indeterminate torsion problem that falls under the first category of
problems described above. This example utilizes the first solution
process described above.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 6.4: Needs title}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A shaft assembly consists of a 12 in long steel section AB (d = 10 in, G
= 11600 ksi)) bonded rigidly to a 9 inch long solid brass section BC (d
= 7 in, G = 5800 ksi). The assembly is to be bolted to walls A and C. If
a torque TB of magnitude 2000 kip in is applied at B, determine the
shear stress in the steel section and the brass section after the ends
are bolted for each of the following end conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Both ends A and C are tightly connected immediately at installation
\item
  There is a slight misalignment at end A that necessitates that that
  end be turned by .5° before the bolts can be tightened.
\end{enumerate}

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

\textbf{Step 1} (for both (a) and (b))

Draw the FBD of the whole body (see below) and write out relevant
equilibrium equations. In this case, that would only be \(\sum M_x=0\).
Note that the assumed directions for TA and TC would usually said to be
completely assumed, with the signs of the answers obtained for them
indicating if the assumed directions are correct. For case(a), this is
still true.

However, for case (b), the direction of TA should be in the direction
opposite to the way the shaft turns as a result of the applied torque,
TB, before the bolt is tightened. The reason for this is illustrated in
Figure 3 below. The assumed direction of TC can be in either direction
for both case (a) and case (b).

{[}figure{]}

{[}figure{]}

Note that the choice of which way the positive x-axis goes on the whole
body FBD is arbitrary. As long as the choice of signs applied to torques
for any global (whole body) equation is based on the same assumption, it
does not matter which direction is chosen to be the positive x
direction. In this case where the positive direction is chosen to be
going to the left, the signs on the torques will be based on the way the
torques are perceived when looking in the direction from A towards C.
Since the direction of TB is known to be counterclockwise from that
perspective, it is drawn in the direction of the positive x-axis and
following from that, TA is drawn to be in the direction of the negative
x-axis. TC is assumed to be the same direction as T.

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sum M_x=-T_A+T_B-T_C=0 \\
T_C+T_A=T_B
\end{gathered}
\]

Since there are two unknowns (TA and TC), but only one equilibrium
equation, the problem is statically indeterminate.

\textbf{Step 2}

Apply kinematic constraint. For case (a), both ends are fixed at the
time of installation so the total angle of twist in the shaft should be
zero:

\[
\varphi_A=\sum \frac{T L}{J G}=\varphi_{A B}+\varphi_{B C}=0
\]

Where TAB and TBC are the internal torques in each of those respective
sections.

For case (b), the misalignment means end A must be turned by 0.5° before
it gets locked in, so the magnitude of the total angle of twist is also
0.5°. The direction of twist is given by considering the loose end of
the shaft to be a free end (as it would be before the bolt is
tightened). If end A is a free end, the internal torque in section AB is
0 and the internal torque in section BC is equal to positive TB. Given
that, we take the angle of twist in the bar at the time of bolt
tightening to also be positive.

So for case (b), the kinematic equation is:

\[
\varphi_A=\sum \frac{T L}{J G}=\varphi_{A B}+\varphi_{B C}=.5^{\circ} * \frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}}
\]

\textbf{Step 3}

Write the compatibility equation by substituting the appropriate
torque-twist equations for the angles of twist.

To implement this step, the internal torque (and sign) for each section
must be established by cutting sections and applying equilibrium.

The FBD for a section made by cutting through section AB is shown in
figure 4.

{[}figure{]}

The equilibrium equation for this section is:

\[
\sum M_x=T_A-T_{A B}=0
\]

So TAB = TA in magnitude and is clockwise since the positive result for
TAB in this case confirms that the arrow should be pointed toward the
cut. Thus, the angle of twist in section AB should be negative.

\[
\varphi_{A B}=-\frac{T_{A B} L_{A B}}{J_{A B} G_{A B}}=\frac{-T_A(12 \mathrm{in})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(10 i n)^4(11600 \mathrm{ksi})}
\]

The FBD for a section made by cutting through section BC is shown in
figure 5.

{[}figure{]}

The equilibrium equation for this section is:

\[
\sum M_x=-T_{B C}+T_C=0
\]

So TBC = TC in magnitude and is counterclockwise since the positive
result for TBC in this case confirms that the arrow should be pointed
away from the cut. Thus, section BC will have a positive angle of twist.

\[
\varphi_{B C}=+\frac{T_{B C} L_{B C}}{J_{B C} G_{B C}}=\frac{T_C(9 \text { in })}{\frac{\pi}{32}(7 i n)^4(5800 \mathrm{ksi})}
\]

Subbing (4) and (6) into (2a) gives the compatibility equation for case
(a):

\[
\frac{-T_A(12 \mathrm{in})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(10 i n)^4(11600 \mathrm{ksi})}+\frac{T_C(9 \mathrm{in})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(7 i n)^4(5800 \mathrm{ksi})}=0
\]

Subbing (4) and (6) into (2b) gives the compatibility equation for case
(b):

\[
\frac{-T_A(12 \mathrm{in})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(10 i n)^4(11600 \mathrm{ksi})}+\frac{T_C(9 \mathrm{in})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(7 i n)^4(5800 \mathrm{ksi})}=.5^{\circ} * \frac{\pi}{180^{\circ}}
\]

\textbf{Step 4}: Solve the equilibrium and compatibility equations for
TA and TC.

For case (a), solving equations (1) and (7) gives TA = 1724 kip in and
TC = 276.0 kip in. Both results work out to be positive, so the assumed
directions are the actual directions assumed on the FBD in figure 4.

For case (b), solving equations (1) and (8) gives TA = 581.3 kip in and
TC = 1419 kip in. Both results work out to be positive, so the assumed
directions are the actual directions.

Now that the reaction torques are known and it was established from
equations (3) and (5) that the internal torques TAB and TBC are equal in
magnitude to TA and TC, respectively, the shear stresses in the two
sections can be calculated.

For case a:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \tau_{A B}=\frac{T_{A B} c_{A B}}{J_{A B}}=\frac{(1724 \mathrm{kip} \mathrm{in}(5 \mathrm{in}))}{\frac{\pi}{32}(10 \mathrm{in})^4}=\quad 8.78 \underline{\underline{\mathrm{ksi}}} \\
& \tau_{B C}=\frac{T_{B C} c_{B C}}{J_{B C}}=\frac{(276.0 \mathrm{kip} \mathrm{in}(3.5 \mathrm{in}))}{\frac{\pi}{32}(7 \mathrm{in})^4}=4.10 \underline{\underline{\mathrm{ksi}}}
\end{aligned}
\]

For case b:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \tau_{A B}=\frac{T_{A B} c_{A B}}{J_{A B}}=\frac{(581.3 \mathrm{kip} \mathrm{in}(5 \mathrm{in}))}{\frac{\pi}{32}(10 \mathrm{in})^4}=\quad 2.96 \mathrm{\underline { \textrm {ksi } }} \\
& \tau_{B C}=\frac{T_{B C} c_{B C}}{J_{B C}}=\frac{(1419 \mathrm{kip} \mathrm{in}(3.5 \mathrm{in}))}{\frac{\pi}{32}(7 \mathrm{in})^4}=21.1 \mathrm{ksi}
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{a:}

\textbf{τAB = 8.78 ksi}

\textbf{τBC = 4.10 ksi}

\textbf{b:}

\textbf{τAB = 2.96 ksi}

\textbf{τBC = 21.1 ksi}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

Example 6.5 goes through using superposition to solve part (a) of the
problem from example 6.4.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 6.5: Needs title}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Re-solve part (a) of example 6.4 using the method of superposition. The
problem is repeated here for convenience.

A shaft assembly consisting of a 12 in long steel steel section AB (d =
10 in, G = 11600 ksi)) bonded rigidly to a 9 inch long solid brass
section BC (d = 7 in, G = 5800 ksi). The assembly is bolted to walls A
and C. If both ends A and C are tightly connected to the walls and a
torque TB of magnitude 2000 kip in is applied at B, determine the shear
stress in the steel section and the brass section.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The first step to solving (global equilibrium) remains the same. The
method of superposition will be applied in step 2 and step 3.

\textbf{Step 1} (for both (a) and (b))

Draw the FBD of the whole body (see Figure 3 below) and write out
whichever equilibrium equations are relevant (the equations that
wouldn't just be 0 = 0). The assumed directions for TA and TC are shown
on the FBD as well as the direction used for the positive x direction.
Recall that the direction of the torque should be determined by looking
from the positive x-axis towards the negative (A to C).

{[}figure{]}

Applying equilibrium in this case reduces down to the sum of the moments
about the x-axis as the only non-trivial equation:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sum M_x=-T_A+T_B-T_C=0 \\
T_C+T_A=T_B
\end{gathered}
\]

Since there are two unknowns (TA and TC), but only one equilibrium
equation, the problem is statically indeterminate.

\textbf{Step 2:} To apply the method of superposition, the support at C
will be considered redundant. The angle of twist for end C relative to A
will then be expressed based on two isolated loading conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Without the reaction at C, so that the assembly acts as if it has a
  free end at C as shown in figure 3. In this case, since there is no
  torque applied between B and C, a section cut within BC shows that the
  that internal torque TBC must be 0 for equilibrium. A section cut
  through AB shows that the internal torque TAB = TB (clockwise, since
  it needs to point towards the cut for the section to be in
  equilibrium). Therefore, the angle of twist with this loading is:\\
  \[
  \varphi_{C / A}=\sum \frac{T L}{J G}=\frac{\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{AB}} \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{AB}}}{\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{AB}} \mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{AB}}}=\frac{-(2000 \mathrm{kip} \mathrm{in})(15 \mathrm{in})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(10 \mathrm{in})^4(11600 \mathrm{ksi})}=-4.215 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{rad}
  \]
\item
  With the reaction at C, but no torque applied at B. Drawing the
  section FBD's in this case reveals that both TAB and TBC are equal in
  magnitude and opposite in direction from TC. Since they are both
  pointed away from the cut, the direction is taken to be
  counterclockwise, or positive. Therefore, the angle of twist with this
  loading is:\\
  \[
  \phi_{C / A}=\sum \frac{T L}{J G}=\frac{\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{AB}} \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{AB}}}{\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{AB}} \mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{AB}}}+\frac{\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{BC}} \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{BC}}}{\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{BC}} \mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{BC}}}=\frac{T_C(12 i n)}{\frac{\pi}{32}(10 i n)^4(11600 k s i)}+\frac{T_C(9 i n)}{\frac{\pi}{32}(7 i n)^4(5800 k s i)}=527^* 10^5 T_{C}
  \]\\
  {[}figure{]}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Step 3}

Now adding the effects of the isolated loading conditions gives the
total angle of twist which should still be equal to zero when the ends
are tightly bolted to the walls without extra twisting.

\[
-4.215 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{rad}+(1.527^* 10^{-5}) T{c}=0
\]

\textbf{Step 4}

Solving for TC gives TC = 276 kip in just as found in example 6.4.

\textbf{Step 5}

Substituting this result into equation (1) also gives the same result as
in example 6.4 for the reaction torque at A, TA = 1724 kip in.

Once again, the corresponding shear stresses are:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{A B} & =\frac{T_{A B} c_{A B}}{J_{A B}}=\frac{(1724 \mathrm{kip} \mathrm{in}(5 \mathrm{in}))}{\frac{\pi}{32}(10 \mathrm{in})^4}=\quad 8.78 \text{ ksi} \\
\tau_{B C} & =\frac{T_{B C} c_{B C}}{J_{B C}}=\frac{(276.0 \mathrm{kip} \mathrm{in}(3.5 \mathrm{in}))}{\frac{\pi}{32}(7 \mathrm{in})^4}=4.10 \text{ ksi}
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{τAB = 8.78 ksi}

Example 6.6 goes through the process of solving a statically
indeterminate torsion problems that falls under the second category of
problems described above.

The vertical shaft assembly consists of a solid brass (G = 40 GPa)
circular shaft completely bonded in section BC to a steel reinforcing
tube (G = 80 GPa). The diameter of the brass is 25 mm along the whole
length while the outer diameter of the steel is 50 mm. The assembly is
subjected to torques TB = 800 N m and TA = 300 N m in the directions
shown. Determine the shear stress in the brass in section AB and in BC.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

First we'll find the shear stress in the brass in section BC. We will
need to determine how much of the internal torque within that section is
carried by the brass.

Step 1 Since the reaction at C is not strictly necessary to solve this
problem, the whole body FBD is not needed here. We will start by
determining the internal reactions in section BC. Cut through section
BC, draw the resulting FBD, and apply equilibrium.

\[
\sum M_x=T_A-T_B-T_{A l}-T_{s t}=0
\]

There is only 1 non-trivial eqilibrium equation and two unknowns, so the
problem is statically indeterminate.

\textbf{Step 2}

Apply the kinematic constraint. In this case, the materials are fully
bonded in section BC, so the materials are constrained to twist as a
unit in the that section. In BC, the kinematic equation is:

\[
\varphi_{B r}=\varphi_{s t}
\]

\textbf{Step 3}

Write the compatibility equation by substituting the appropriate torque
twist equations into equation (2).

\[
\frac{\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{Br}} \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{Br}}}{\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{Br}} G_{\mathrm{Br}}}=\frac{\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{st}} \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{st}}}{\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{st}} \mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{st}}}
\]

The lengths are equal and therefore cancel out. Rearranging (3) to solve
for T\textsubscript{st} in terms of T\textsubscript{Br} and filling in
values:

\[
T_{s t}=\frac{T_{B r} J_{s t} G_{s t}}{J_{B r} G_{B r}}=\frac{T_{B r} \frac{\pi}{32}\left((0.05 m)^4-(0.025 m)^4\right)\left(80 \times 10^9 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}^2}\right)}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.025 \mathrm{~m})^4\left(40 \times 10^9 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}^2}\right)}=30.0 \mathrm{~T}_{\mathrm{Br}}
\]

Subbing this result into equation (1) gives T\textsubscript{Br} in
section BC to be T\textsubscript{Br} = 16.13 N·m. Applying the shear
stress equation gives:

\[
\tau_{B r}(B C)=\frac{T_{B r} c_{B r}}{J_{B r}}=\frac{16.13 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}(0.0125 \mathrm{~m})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.025 \mathrm{~mm})^4}=5.26 \mathrm{MPa}
\]

Next we'll find the shear stress in the brass in section AB. Since this
section consists only of the brass, all of the internal torque in that
section is carried by the brass. Making a cut within that section and
applying equilibrium shows that the magnitude of the internal torque
T\textsubscript{AB} = T\textsubscript{A} = 300 Nm.

Applying the shear stress equation gives:

\[
\tau_{B r}(B C)=\frac{T_{B r} c_{B r}}{J_{B r}}=\frac{300 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}(0.0125 \mathrm{~mm})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.025 \mathrm{~mm})^4}=97.8 \mathrm{MPa}
\]

\textbf{τBR in section BC is 5.26 MPa}

\textbf{τBR in section AB is 97.8 MPa}

\section{Power Transmission}\label{sec-6.4}

Click to expand

As mentioned in the introduction to torsion, one common application in
which one would encounter circular shafts subjected to torsion is in
power transmission shafts. In these types of assemblies, shafts are
connected through gears and belts and apply torque to one another
through these connections. If a shaft somewhere in the assembly is
connected to a motor that causes it to rotate, that rotation is then
transmitted to other connected shafts which can in turn transmit
rotation to even more shafts. Note that such systems are still
considered to be in equilibrium even with the rotation as long as the
angular velocity is constant.

\subsection{Definition of Power}\label{definition-of-power}

You may recall from other subjects of study that power is defined to be
the time rate of change of work. The definition of work is force times
distance. So power can be calculated as:

\[
P=\frac{W}{t}=\frac{F \times d}{t}
\]

Within the context of rotating shafts, the force would be the force
applied to the outer edge of the shaft that results in torque and the
distance would be the arc length that a point on the edge of the shaft
travels around the circumference in a given amount of time, t. Figure
6.4.1 illustrates this point.

\textbf{Figure 6.14:} Force applied to rotation shaft results in work

If the arclength over which point B travels, BB' = rθ, then W = Frθ.
However, Fr is also equal to the torque T on the shaft, so W = Tθ.

Going back to the power equation, we then have \(P=\frac{T \theta}{t}\).
The \(\frac{\theta}{t}\) is angular velocity, which will be denoted with
the Greek letter ω. So the power equation can finally be expressed as P
= Tω, where ω must be expressed in radians per second.

\subsection{Units}\label{units-1}

In SI the standard unit for power is the Watt (W), which is (N m)/s. The
N m unit is also referred to as a Joule, so a Watt is a Joule/s.

In US Customary units, power is commonly expressed as ft lb/s or in
lb/s. However, it is also common to express power in terms of
horsepower, where there are 550 ft lb/s for 1 hp. Note that there is a
conversion difference between the US horsepower and the British
horsepower. In this text, horsepower will refer to the US version.

When applying the P = Tω equation, the angular velocity ω must be
expressed in radians per second. If frequency is given in Hz, which is 1
revolution/s, then one must multiply by 2π to convert it to rad/s since
there are 2π rad per revolution.

If angular velocity is given in rpm, which is revolution per minute,
then one must multiply by 2π radians per revolution and divide by 60 to
convert 1/min to 1/s. This reduces to an overall multiplication factor
of π/30 to convert from rpm to rad/s.

equilibrium, this force must be equal in magnitude but opposite in
direction. The force results in a torque which can be expressed as T =
Fr.

\textbf{Figure 6.15:} Gear interaction results in the application of
force and torque

Given that the force on each gear is equal in magnitude to the force on
the other, we can write:

\[
F=\frac{T_A}{r_A}=\frac{T_B}{r_B}
\]

which then allows us to express the torque exerted by one gear in terms
of the torque exerted by the other as well as the ratio of radii:

\[
T_A=\frac{r_A}{r_B} T_B
\]

The ratio of radii is known as the gear ratio. It can be expressed in
terms of the ratio of gear radii, gear diameters, or the number of teeth
on each gear.

\subsection{Angular Velocity Ratio of Connected
Shafts}\label{angular-velocity-ratio-of-connected-shafts}

When two shafts are connected by a pair of gears, conservation of energy
would dictate that the power transferred into one shaft equals the power
transferring out of the other (power in = power out, assuming losses are
negligible).

So if PA = TAωA and PB = TBωB and PA = PB, then we get
\(\omega_A=\frac{T_B}{T_A} \omega_B\)

Further using the gear ratio relationship between TB and TA gives:

\[
\omega_A=\frac{r_B}{r_A} \omega_B
\]

Note that the gear ratio in this case is inverse of the one used to
relate torques.

\subsection{Angle of Twist}\label{angle-of-twist}

When two connected gears rotate, they will have equal arclengths of
travel for a given amount of shaft rotation, but in opposite directions,
as depicted in figure 6.4.3. This means that rAφA = - rBφB, and the
angle of twist at point B for the shaft that it is on can be related to
the angle of twist at the same location on the shaft that gear A is on.

\[
\varphi_A=-\frac{r_B}{r_A} \varphi_B
\]

As with the angular velocities, notice that the gear ratio is the
inverse as that used to relate torques.

\textbf{Figure 6.16:} Connected gears travel the same distance in
opposite directions.

In example 6.7, a problem of power transmission with connected gears is
presented which utilizes the above concepts.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 6.7: Needs title}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

60 kW of power is transmitted to gear D of the assembly at 33 Hz. Shaft
CD is allowed to turn freely within its bearings in the direction shown
at D. End A of shaft AB is attached rigidly to the wall. Determine the
angle of twist of point D relative to A.

Assume gear C has 35 teeth around it's circumference and gear B has 50
teeth. In addition, shaft AB (d = 40 mm) is 450 mm long and shaft CD (d
= 30 mm) is 700 mm long. Both shafts are made of steel (G = 80 GPa).

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

In general, we can think of the angle of twist at D to be equal to
whatever the angle of twist of point C is plus the angle of twist of
shaft CD. If the shaft were completely co-linear (no gear connection),
the angle of twist at B would be equal to the angle of twist at C. In
this case, we would calculate the angle of twist as:

\[
\varphi_{D / A}=\varphi_{A B}+\varphi_{C D}
\]

However, the gear connection causes the angle of twist at point C on
shaft CD to be different from the angle of twist of point B, so we will
express the angle of twist at D as:

\[
\varphi_{D / A}=\varphi_C+\varphi_{C D}
\]

To calculate the angle of twist at D, we will need to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Calculate the torque being applied at D based on the power
  information. When considering units, recall that a Watt is a N m/s and
  a Hz is a revolution per second.\\
  \[
  T_D=\frac{P_D}{\omega}=\frac{60000 \mathrm{~W}}{33 \mathrm{~Hz}\left(\frac{2 \pi \mathrm{rad}}{\mathrm{Hz}}\right)}=289.4 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}
  \]
\item
  Based on the torque at D, calculate the torque at C by applying
  equilibrium to shaft CD:\\
  \[
  \sum M_x=T_D-T_C=0 \text { so } \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}=\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{D}}
  \]\\
  {[}figure{]}\\
  If we look from D towards C, the given direction of TD is
  counterclockwise, so TC = 289.4 N m (clockwise).
\item
  Use the gear ratio to relate the torque exerted on gear C to the
  torque exerted on gear B:\\
  \[
  T_B=\frac{N_B}{N_C} T_c=\frac{50}{35}(289.4 \mathrm{Nm})=413.4 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}
  \]
\item
  Calculate φ\textsubscript{B} = φ\textsubscript{AB}. The FBD of a
  section cut from AB shows that the internal torque T\textsubscript{AB}
  = T\textsubscript{B}. Note that the direction of T\textsubscript{B} is
  shown as clockwise when viewed in the direction of B towards A. One
  can determine this based on the fact that shaft CD is shown to rotate
  counterclockwise, which results in a clockwise torque imposed from
  gear C onto gear B. Equilibrium shows that the internal torque
  T\textsubscript{AB} is then also clockwise so φ\textsubscript{B} will
  be negative.\\
  {[}figure{]}\\
  \[
  \varphi_B=\frac{T_{A B} L_{A B}}{J_{A B} G_{A B}}=-\frac{413.4 \mathrm{~N} \cdot m(0.450 \mathrm{~m})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.04 m)^4\left(80 \times 10^9 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}^2}\right)}=-0.009252 \text{ rad}
  \]
\item
  Use the gear ratio to relate the angle of twist at B to the angle of
  twist at C:\\
  \[
  \varphi_C=-\frac{N_B}{N_C} \varphi_B=-\frac{50}{35}(-.009252 \text{ rad})=.01322 \text{ rad}
  \]
\item
  Determine and use the internal torque T\textsubscript{CD} to determine
  φ\textsubscript{CD}. Cutting a section through shaft CD and drawing
  the FBD shows that T\textsubscript{CD} = T\textsubscript{D}
  (counterclockwise), so:\\
  {[}figure{]}\\
  \[
  \varphi_{C D}=\frac{T_{C D} L_{C D}}{J_{C D} G_{C D}}=\frac{289.4 \mathrm{~N} \cdot m(0.700 \mathrm{~m})}{\frac{\pi}{32}(0.03 m)^4\left(80 \times 10^9 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}^2}\right)}=.03184 \text{ rad}
  \]
\item
  Calculate φ\textsubscript{D/A} = φ\textsubscript{C} +
  φ\textsubscript{CD}\\
  \[
  \varphi_{D / A}=.01322 \mathrm{rad}+.03184 \mathrm{rad}=.04506 \text{ rad}

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{φ\textsubscript{D} = .04506 rad}

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH7 PNGs/figure 7.1.png}

}

\caption{Figure 7.1: Examples of structural beams}

\end{figure}%

Beams are structural members that support loads along their length.
Typically, these loads are perpendicular to the axis of the beam and
cause only shear and bending moments.

\textbf{{[}Figure 7.2 Overarching book figure{]}}

As we found in previous chapters, internal forces and moments are
crucial to calculating stresses and deflections. The same is true for
finding stresses and deflections in beams. Due to the nature of the
loadings and constraints of beams, finding internal forces requires new
methods in statics. This chapter describes these methods for finding a
beam's internal shear force and bending moments.

\subsection*{Sign convention}\label{sign-convention}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Sign convention}

Before we can present methods for finding internal shear and moments of
beams, we need to establish a sign convention. This way, we provide
consistency and know how to interpret our results. It should be noted
that anytime you start a new project or subject you should ensure that a
sign convention is established.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=2.97917in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/figure 7.3.png}

}

\caption{Figure 7.3: Needs caption}

\end{figure}%

For the purposes of this book, the shear is positive when the external
forces shear off as depicted in the figure above. Another way to think
about it is that a positive shear is when the internal shear forces
cause a clockwise rotation of the beam segment.

The bending moment is positive when the external forces bend the beam in
a concave up shape as indicated in the figure. This causes the top
fibers of the beam to be in compression while the bottom fibers are in
tension.

\section{Internal Shear Force and Bending Moment by
Equilibrium}\label{sec-7.1}

Click to expand

One way to find internal shear and bending forces is to cut sections and
analyze the free-body diagrams, as we did in previous chapters of this
book. The first step for a statically determinate beam is to find the
external reactions. To determine the internal forces at any point along
the beam, cut the section at that point and draw the free-body diagram
from that point to one end of the beam. We will replace the cut with an
internal shear force, V, and an internal moment, M, and then use
equilibrium equations to solve for those internal.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 7.1}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Find the internal shear and bending moment at points J, K, and L in the
beam pictured below.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.72917in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.1 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The first step is to find the external reactions at the supports A and
B.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.71875in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.1 part 1 2.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sum F_x=A_x=0 \\
& \sum M_A=-40{~kips}*4{~ft}-10{~kips}*18{~ft}+B_y*20{~ft}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad B_y=17{~kips} \\
& \sum F_y=A_y-40-10+17=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad A_y=33{~kips}
\end{aligned}
\]

Next, we will draw a free-body diagram of the right end of the beam from
point A to J by cutting the beam at section J. The internal forces
V\textsubscript{J} and M\textsubscript{J} are placed at the point of the
cut using the positive sign convention. Note: You can assume the
direction of these forces; the statics will work out the correct
direction.

\textbf{Section J}

To find the internal shear, we will sum forces in the y-direction. To
find the internal moment, we will sum moments at point J.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.44792in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.1 part 3.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sum F_y=33{~kips}-V_J=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad V_J=33{~kips} \\
&\sum  M_J=-33{~kips}*2{~ft}+M_J=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad M_J=66{~kip}\cdot{ft}
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{Section K}

To find the internal shear, we will sum forces in the y-direction. To
find the internal moment, we will sum moments at point K.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.88542in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.1 part 4.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sum F_y=33{~kips}-40{~kips}-V_k=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad V_k=-7{~kips} \\
&\sum M_k=-33{~kips}*10{~ft}+40{~kips}*6{ft})+M_k \quad\rightarrow\quad M_k=90{~kip}\cdot{ft}
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{Section L}

To find the internal shear, we will sum forces in the y-direction. To
find the internal moment, we will sum moments at point L.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.90625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.1 part 5.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sum F_y=33{~kips}-40{~kips}-10{~kips}-V_L=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad V_L=-17{~kips} \\
&\sum M_L=-33{~kips}*19{~ft})+40{~kips}*15{~ft}+10{~kips}*1{ft}+M_L=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad
M_L=17{~kip}\cdot{ft}
\end{aligned}
\]

We can observe that the internal forces vary at different points along
the length of the beam. This method of finding the internal stresses is
convenient when the loading is simple or when you know a specific point
along the length of the beam. However, as the loading gets more complex,
we should consider one of the methods outlined in the following
sections.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Relationship between Load, Shear, and Moment}\label{sec-7.2}

Click to expand

There is a relationship between loading, shear, and moment (and as you
will see later in this text, slope and deflection) in a beam. Consider
the beam below, which is subjected to a distributed load, w per unit
length.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.875in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/figure 7.4.png}
\end{center}

We will now look at a small section from that beam that has a width of
Δx, shown below. We replaced the distributed load with a resultant force
ΔF (this is indicated by a dashed arrow in the FBD).

Since we cut both sides of the beam, we replace each cut with internal
shear and moment forces assuming the positive sign convention from the
previous section in this chapter.

\subsection{Relationship between Load and
Shear}\label{relationship-between-load-and-shear}

This FBD is in static equilibrium so we can use our equilibrium equation
to sum forces in the y-direction and set it equal to zero.

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum F_y=0 & =V-\Delta F-(V+\Delta V) \\
\Delta V & =-\Delta F
\end{aligned}
\]

OR \[
\Delta v=\Delta x
\]

Dividing both sides by Δx and then letting Δx approach zero gives us:

\[
\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta x}=\frac{d v}{d x}=w
\]

We could then rearrange this by multiplying both sides of the equation
by dx.

\[
d v=w d x
\]

Now we can integrate between any two points A and B on the beam:

\[
\underbrace{\Delta v}_{\substack{\text{change in} \\ \text{shear}}}=\int\underbrace{w d x}_{\substack{\text{area under} \\ \text {loading curve}}} \text{ Equation 11.1}
\]

Equation 11.1 is valid for distributed loads and not when there is a
discontinuity in the shear diagram that is caused by concentrated loads.
This relationship should only be used between concentrated loads.

\subsection{Relationship between Shear and
Moment}\label{relationship-between-shear-and-moment}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.07292in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/figure 7.5.png}
\end{center}

Let's go back to the FBD of the small section of the beam subjected to a
distributed load. We can apply another static equilibrium equation,
summing moments about point C:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum M_c=0 & =-M-V(\Delta x)+\Delta F\left(\frac{1}{2} \Delta x\right)+(M+\Delta M) \\
\Delta M & =M+V \Delta x-(w \Delta x)\left(\frac{1}{2} \Delta x\right)-M \\
\Delta M & =V \Delta x-\frac{1}{2} w \Delta x^2
\end{aligned}
\]

Dividing both sides by Δx and then letting Δx approach zero gives us:

\[
\underbrace{\frac{\Delta M}{\Delta x}}_{\text { Slope of moment diagram}}=\underbrace{V}_{\text {shear }}
\]

We could then rearrange this by multiplying both sides of the equation
by dx.

\[
d M=V d x
\]

Now we can integrate between any two points A and B on the beam:

\[
\underbrace{\Delta M}_{\text {Change in moment}}=\underbrace{\int V d x}_{\text {Area under shear diagram }} \text{ Equation 11.2}
\]

Similar to equation 11.1, equation 11.2 is not valid at points where a
concentrated force or concentrated moment occurs. These concentrated
loads cause discontinuities in the moment diagram however, equation 11.2
can be used in between these concentrated loads.

\subsection{How can I use my calculus knowledge when building Shear and
Moment
Diagrams?}\label{how-can-i-use-my-calculus-knowledge-when-building-shear-and-moment-diagrams}

In a basic sense, the relationship between load, shear, and moment can
be described in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=2.05208in,height=1.05208in]{images/CH7 PNGs/figure 5.6.png}

}

\caption{Figure 7.6: Relationship between load, shear, and moment}

\end{figure}%

We can combine these relationships with what we know about derivatives
and integrals from our calculus course. Here are some items of note:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The slope of the shear diagram at any point is the derivative of the
  shear function evaluated at that point. This is equal to the sign and
  magnitude of the distributed load. If there is no load on a section of
  the beam then the slope of the shear diagram would be zero.
\item
  Similarly, the slope of the moment diagram at any point is the
  derivative of the moment function evaluated at that point. This is
  equal to the sign and magnitude of the shear at that point.
\item
  The area under the distributed load between two points is equal to the
  change in the shear between those same two points.
\item
  The area under the shear diagram between two points is equal to the
  change in the moment between those same two points.
\item
  The maximum moment occurs where its derivative (shear) is equal to
  zero.
\item
  At the points of concentrated forces, the shear diagram will jump up
  or down depending on the direction of the force. If the force is up
  then the shear diagram will jump up, and if the force is down, the
  shear diagram will drop down.
\item
  At the points of concentrated moments, the moment diagram will jump up
  or down depending on the direction of the rotation. If the
  concentrated moment is clockwise, the moment diagram will jump up, and
  if it is counter-clockwise, the moment diagram will drop down. This
  ``opposite'' direction effect is for the internal bending moment is
  the reaction to the applied moment to stay consistent with the
  established sign convention. The shear diagram will not be impacted.
\item
  If the load can be represented with a polynomial, then we can easily
  predict the degree of the subsequent shear and moment functions. For
  example, if the load is a uniformly distributed load (constant), the
  shear will be a linear function (n+1), and the moment will be a
  parabola (n+2).
\end{itemize}

Use all that you know about calculus and the relationships between
functions when you derive and integrate to build, check, and analyze
your shear and moment diagrams.

\section{Determining Equations by Equilibrium and
Equations}\label{sec-7.3}

Click to expand

The easy relationship between load, shear, and moment allows us to build
complete shear and moment diagrams using a few different methods. This
section shows you a method that will work for both simple and
complicated loading situations. Let's work through an example to
illustrate this method.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 7.2}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.29167in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.2 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The first step is to draw a FBD of the beam being sure to change the
supports to the correct external reaction forces, as shown below.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.15625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.2 part 2.png}
\end{center}

We will then use static equilibrium equations to solve for the magnitude
of the support reactions.

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sum F_x=A_x=0 \\
&\sum M_A=-4\frac{kips}{ft}*6{~ft}*3{~ft}-18{~kips}*8{~ft}+B_y*10{~ft}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad B_y =21.6{~kips} \\
&\sum F_y=A_y-4\frac{kips}{ft}*6{~ft}-18{~kips}+21.6{~kips}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad A_y =20.4{~kips}
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.15625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.2 part 3.png}
\end{center}

Now we will cut a cross-section within the loading region we are
concerned with. When choosing sections be sure to cut within the uniform
load and between loads and reactions. For this example, we will need to
cut three sections to get the complete shear and moment diagram. These
sections are depicted with the green lines. We will then use equilibrium
equations to find the internal shear force as a function of x, V(x).

\textbf{Section between A and C}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.76042in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.2 part 4.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sum F_y=20.4-4(x) -V=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad V(x)=-4 x+20.4 \\
&\sum M_0=-20.4(x)+4(x)\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+M=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad M(x)=-2 x^2+20.4 x \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Notice that you can give a quick check on your statics as V(x) is the
derivative of M(x). For polynomials, this is a quick test to see if your
equations make sense.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.05208in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.2 part 5.png}
\end{center}

We can plot our V(x) and M(x) equations on an axis from x = 0 to x =
6ft. Solving our equations at these points gives:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&V(0)=-4(0)+20.4=20.4{~kips} \\
&V(6)=-4(6)+20.4=-3.6{~kips}
\\
&M(0)=-2(0)^2+20.4(0)=0 \\
&M(6)=-2(6)^2+20.4(6)=50.4{~kip}\cdot{ft}
\end{aligned}
\]

Notice how we draw the shear diagram directly below the beam and the
moment diagram directly below the shear. These three (load, shear, and
moment) share the same x-axis, whereas the vertical axis for the Shear
(V) and Moment (M) diagrams have different units and possibly different
scales.

Drawing the shear and moment diagrams directly below the beam is good
practice so that you can get a complete picture of what is going on
along the length of the beam.

\textbf{Section between C and D}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.3125in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.2 part 6.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum &F_y=20.4-4(6)-V=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad V(x)=-3.6 \\
\sum &M_0=-20.4(x)+4(6)(x-3)+M=0 \\
&M(x)=+20.4 x-24 x+72 \\
&M(x)=-3.6 x+72 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.27083in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.2 part 7.png}
\end{center}

Again, we can add the section from C to D using our V(x) and M(x)
equations. You will notice that since there are no applied loads on the
beam from C to D, the shear diagram is constant. This means that the
moment diagram is linear between x = 6 and x = 8 ft.

\[
\begin{aligned}
&V(6)=-3.6{~kips} \\
&M(6)=-3.6(6)+72=50.4{~kip}\cdot{ft} \\
&V(8)=-3.6 {kips} \\
&M(8)=-3.6(8)+72=43.2{~kip}\cdot{ft} \\

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.21875in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.2 part 9.png}
\end{center}

Finally, we will graph the V(x) and M(x) equations we obtained from
point D to point B (x = 8 to x = 10 ft).

\[
\begin{aligned}
&V(8)=-21.6{~kips} \\
&M(8)=-21.6(8)+216=43.2{~kip}\cdot{ft} \\
&V(10)-21.6{~kips} \\
&M(10)=-21.6(10)+216=0 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

We now have complete shear and moment diagrams. Be sure that you label
your axis, including units, and all pertinent values.

These diagrams are used in the design of the beam and its components.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.1875in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.2 part 10.png}
\end{center}

We can see that in this example, the entire length of the beam is
subjected to positive moment. Going back to our sign convention from the
beginning of this chapter, a positive moment indicates a concave up
behavior. When we look at the beam and the external loads it makes sense
as the beam will want to bend concave up between supports, as shown in
the figure.

\section{Graphical Method Shear Force and Bending Moment
Diagrams}\label{sec-7.4}

Click to expand

When the loading is relatively simple, consisting of concentrated
forces, concentrated moments, and uniformly distributed loads, we can
use geometry to find the area of the load and shear diagrams since the
shapes are simple. Let's work through an example to illustrate this
method.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 7.3}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the beam shown.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.98958in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.65625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 2.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The first step is to draw a FBD of the beam, being sure to change the
supports to the correct external reaction forces, as shown below.

We will then use static equilibrium equations to solve for the magnitude
of the support reactions.

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sum F_x=A_x=0 \\
&\sum M_A=-4\frac{kN}{m}(6{~m})(5{~m})-10{~kN}(8{~m})+B_y(10{~m})-15{~kN}(12{~m})=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad B_y =38{~kN} \\
&\sum F_y=A_y-4\frac{kN}{m}(6{~m})-10{~kN}-15{~kN}+38{~kN} \quad\rightarrow\quad A_y =11{~kN}
\end{aligned}
\]

Now that we know the external forces, we can build the shear diagram. We
will start at the leftmost point of the beam, point A.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.54167in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 3.png}
\end{center}

The first force we encounter is at point A, the reaction force of 11kN.
The force is going up, so we will do that same thing on our shear
diagram.

From that point, we look at the beam, and there are no forces acting
between points A and C. This indicates that our shear diagram will
remain constant at 11kN.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.51042in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 4.png}
\end{center}

The 4kN/m uniformly distributed load starts at point C and goes for 6
meters until point D. The force is going down for a total of 24kN (4kN/m
* 6m). Since the load is constant from point C to D, the shear will be
linear between those points. The slope of the shear diagram will be -4
and over those 6 meters will decrease the total of 24kN.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.52083in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 5.png}
\end{center}

At point D, there is a concentrated 10kN load going down. On the shear
diagram, this load will be represented by a discontinuity, jumping down
by 10kN to -23kN.

From that point, we look at the beam, and there are no forces acting
between points D and B. This indicates that our shear diagram will
remain constant at -23kN.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.51042in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 6.png}
\end{center}

At point B, the roller support, there is an external reaction of 38kN
going up. This concentrated force will cause a discontinuity in the
shear diagram. From -23kN we will add 38kN to end at 15kN.

From that point, we look at the beam, and there are no forces acting
between points B and E. This indicates that our shear diagram will
remain constant at 15kN.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.5in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 7.png}
\end{center}

At point E, there is a 15kN concentrated force going down. This
concentrated force will cause a discontinuity in the shear diagram. From
15kN we subtract 15kN to end back at zero.

The shear diagram should start and end at zero. At the end of the beam,
our shear diagram ``closes,'' which means that we end back at zero. This
is a good check that you are on the right track. If you round your
reactions you might be slightly off at the end of your shear diagram.

Now that we have the shear diagram, we can build the moment diagram.
Remember from the previous section that the internal moment is the area
under the shear diagram. Our shear diagram consists of basic shapes
(rectangles and triangles) so we can use geometry to find these areas.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.47917in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 8.png}
\end{center}

Just like for the shear diagram, we will start at zero at the leftmost
point of the beam, point A. Our first section from A to C is a
rectangle. We will calculate the area under the shear curve to find the
change in the internal moment between A and C. We will keep in mind the
following three things:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Magnitude of the Change.} This is the area under the curve.
  The height of the rectangle is 11kN, and the width is 2m, so the area
  is 22kN*m.
\item
  \textbf{Direction of the Change.} This area is on the positive side of
  the shear diagram, which indicates that it will go up from A to C.
\item
  \textbf{Shape of the Segment.} The shear diagram is constant, so the
  moment diagram will be linear with a slope of 11.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.45833in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 9.png}
\end{center}

From point C to D there are two triangles, one that is on the positive
side of the shear diagram and the other that is on the negative side.

\textbf{To calculate the area under the curve we will need to first
calculate the distance from point C to where the shear diagram crosses
the x-axis.}

There are many ways to do this. We illustrate using similar triangles to
find this distance. In the figure, we are comparing the larger yellow
triangle and the smaller pink triangle, where our unknown distance x is
the base. We set up the following proportion to accomplish this:

\[
\frac{24{~kN}}{6{~m}}=\frac{11{~kN}}{x} \quad \therefore \quad x=2.75 \mathrm{~m}
\]

\emph{Magnitude of the Change}

This is the area under the curve. The area of the triangle is 15.125
kN*m {[}A = ½ (2.75m)(11kN){]}

\emph{Direction of the Change}

This area is on the positive side of the shear diagram, which indicates
that it will go up from C to the zero point on the shear diagram. So we
will add the area, 15.125, to the internal moment at point C (22kN*m) to
be at 37.125 kN*m at the point of zero shear.

\emph{Shape of the Segment}

The shear diagram is linear, so the moment diagram will be parabolic
that is concave down.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.39583in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 10.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{We can now account for the second triangle from C to D.}

\emph{Magnitude of the Change}

This is the area under the curve. The area of the triangle is

\(A=\frac{1}{2}*(6-2.75)*13=21.125{~kN\cdot m}\)

\emph{Direction of the Change}

This area is on the negative side of the shear diagram, which indicates
that it will go down from the point of zero shear to point D. So we will
subtract the area, 21.125 to the internal moment at the zero point
(37.125kN) to be at 16 kN*m at the point D.

\emph{Shape of the Segment}

The shear diagram is linear, so the moment diagram will be parabolic
that is concave down. The concavity of a parabolic function can be
determined by examining whether the shear diagram is increasing or
decreasing. In this example, the shear diagram is decreasing between
points C and D so the parabola will be concave down.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.38542in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 11.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{We are now able to account for the section from D to B.}

\emph{Magnitude of the Change}

This is the area under the curve. The height of the rectangle is 23kN,
and the width is 2m, so the area is 46kN*m.

\emph{Direction of the Change}

This area is on the negative side of the shear diagram, which indicates
that it will go down from D to B. We will subtract the area from the
internal moment at D. So we will do 16 - 46 to end at negative 30.

\emph{Shape of the Segment}

The shear diagram is constant, so the moment diagram will be linear with
a slope of -23.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.36458in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 12.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Finally, we can build our moment diagram from B to E.}

\emph{Magnitude of the Change}

This is the area under the curve. The height of the rectangle is 15kN,
and the width is 2m, so the area is 30kN*m.

\emph{Direction of the Change}

This area is on the positive side of the shear diagram, which indicates
that it will go up from B to E. We will add the area from the internal
moment at B. So we will do (-30 + 30) to end at zero.

\emph{Shape of the Segment}

The shear diagram is constant, so the moment diagram will be linear with
a slope of +15.

At the end of the beam, our moment diagram ``closes,'' which means that
we end back at zero. Moment diagrams must start and end at zero. This is
a good check that you are on the right track. If you round your
reactions and areas, you might be slightly off at the end of your moment
diagram.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.36458in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 13.png}
\end{center}

Our final product is in the figure on the left. For a complete shear and
moment diagram your axis should be labeled, including units, and the
pertinent values indicated on each diagram. As we mentioned earlier it
is best to draw these right below the beam so it is easy to see what the
internal shear and bending moment forces are in relation to a location
on the beam.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.80208in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.3 part 14.png}
\end{center}

We can see that in this example, this beam is subjected to both positive
and negative moments. Remember from the beginning of this chapter that a
positive moment indicates concave up bending behavior, and a negative is
concave down. When we look at the beam and the external loads it makes
sense as the beam will want to bend concave up between supports in the
area of positive moment. The beam will then bend concave down over
support B in the area of negative moment, as shown in the figure.

This beam a little different than other examples in this chapter as the
support is a fixed end and includes a force-couple system at point C.
However, the processes that we presented here still apply in this
situation.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.5625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.4 part 2.png}
\end{center}

The first step is to draw a FBD of the beam, being sure to change the
supports to the correct external reaction forces, as shown to the left.
The 2 kips that acts on the arm at point B will cause a force on beam AD
at the connection point, C. Additionally there will be a concentrated
moment from this force that also acts at point C. The magnitude of this
concentrated moment is (2kips)*(1 ft) or 2 k*ft counter clockwise.

We will then use static equilibrium equations to solve for the magnitude
of the support reactions.

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sum F_x=A x=0 \\
&\sum F_y=A_y-2{~kips}-5{~kips}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad A_y=7{~kips} \\
&\sum M_A = M_A + 2{~kip\cdot ft} - 2{~kips}(3{~ft}) - 5{~kips}(6{~ft})=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad M_A=34{~kip\cdot ft} \\
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.59375in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.4 part 3.png}
\end{center}

We can now build the shear diagram. Keep in mind that the concentrated
moments (at point A and C) do not contribute to the shear diagram.

We start with the vertical reaction at point A. This is going up 7 kips.
Then between A and C there are no loads on the beam so the shear diagram
remains constant.

The concentrated force at point C is 2 kips down. So we will subtract 2
kips from 7 kips. There are no loads between points C and D so the shear
diagram remains constant at 5 kips.

At point D there is a concentrated load of 5 kips down. This will bring
our shear diagram to a close at zero.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.97917in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.4 part 4.png}
\end{center}

We will build the moment diagram with the combination of the area of the
shear diagram and the concentrated moments.

We start from zero and go down 34 kip·ft since the reaction at A,
M\textsubscript{A}, is counter-clockwise.

\textbf{Between A and B}

\emph{Magnitude of the Change}

This is the area under the curve. The height of the rectangle is 7 kips,
and the width is 3 ft, so the area is 21 kip·ft.

\emph{Direction of the Change}

This area is on the positive side of the shear diagram, which indicates
that it will go up from A to C. We will add the area from the internal
moment at A (-34 + 21 = -13 kip·ft).

\emph{Shape of the Segment}

The shear diagram is constant, so the moment diagram will be linear with
a slope of +7 kips/ft.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.92708in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.4 part 5.png}
\end{center}

At point C, there is an applied concentrated moment of 2 kip·ft
counter-clockwise. This will create a discontinuity in the moment
diagram by dropping down 2 (-13 -- 2 = -15 kip·ft).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.875in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.4 part 6.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{Between C and D}

\emph{Magnitude of the Change}

This is the area under the curve. The height of the rectangle is 5 kips,
and the width is 3 ft, so the area is 15 kip·ft.

\emph{Direction of the Change}

This area is on the positive side of the shear diagram, which indicates
that it will go up from C to D. We will add the area from the internal
moment at A (-15 + 15 = 0).

\emph{Shape of the Segment}

The shear diagram is constant, so the moment diagram will be linear with
a slope of +5 kip/ft.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.02083in,height=\textheight]{images/CH7 PNGs/example 7.4 part 7.png}
\end{center}

The final shear and moment diagram is in the figure to the left. You
will notice that this cantilever structure with downward loads will bend
concave down. This indicates that the entire beam will be in negative
moment---which is what our moment diagram indicates.

As we found in previous chapters, geometric cross-section properties are
critical to calculating stresses and deformations for members subjected
to axial and torsional loads. The same is true for finding stresses and
deflections in beams subjected to shear and bending loads. This chapter
describes methods for finding section properties necessary to calculate
the stress and deflection in beams. Specifically, the centroid and the
second moment of area. You likely were presented with these topics in
Statics, so this chapter is designed to be a review.

\section{Centroid}\label{sec-8.1}

Click to expand

An object possesses weight due to the gravitational force acting on its
constituent particles. The collective effect of these forces yields the
total weight of the object, which is concentrated at a single point
known as the \textbf{center of gravity}. If the object is comprised of a
homogenous (constant density) material, then the center of gravity is
the same as the geometric center or centroid. In this section, we will
focus our discussions on the centroid of an area for common structural
shapes. For a more comprehensive discussion on the center of gravity,
the center of mass, calculating centroids using integration, and
distributed loads, see the
\href{https://engineeringstatics.org/Chapter_07-center-of-mass.html}{Engineering
Statics} book by Baker and Haynes.

The location of the centroid of an area is the point where the first
moment of area equals zero. The first moment of area about a point is
calculated by multiplying the area by the perpendicular distance to the
point. The centroid of an area can be found by splitting the area into a
number (i) of discrete parts, summing the moment of area for these
discrete parts, and then dividing by the sum of the area. We can use
these weighted averages to find the location \((\bar{X}, \bar{Y})\) of
the centroid of the area:

{[}text{]} - some of the equations need to be numbered in this chapter

\[
\bar{X}=\frac{\sum \bar{x}_i A_i}{\sum A_i}
\]

\[
\bar{Y}=\frac{\sum \bar{y}_i A_i}{\sum A_i}
\]

where

\(\bar{X}, \bar{Y}\) = Centroid coordinates of the overall area {[}m,
in{]}

\(\bar{x}_i, \bar{y}_i\) = Centroid coordinates of each discrete area
{[}m, in{]}

\(A_i\) = Area of each discrete area {[}m\textsuperscript{2},
in\textsuperscript{2}{]}

We can find centroids of simple shapes easily by utilizing symmetry.
When a shape possesses an axis of symmetry, each point on one side of
the axis corresponds to another point symmetrically located on the
opposite side. The distances between these mirrored points and the line
of symmetry will sum to zero because they will be equal in magnitude but
opposite in sign. This is true for every point in the shape, so the
numerator of equations 8.1 and/or 8.2 (the first moment of area) will be
zero. Therefore, if a shape features a line of symmetry, its centroid
must coincide with this line. In cases where a shape exhibits multiple
lines of symmetry, the centroid is located at their intersection, as
shown in Figure 8.2.

\textbf{Figure 8.2:} Centroids lie upon axes of symmetry.

In this text, we will use common shapes or a composite of common shapes
for our cross-sections. Appendix E includes the location of the centroid
of some common shapes. Part of Appendix E is reproduced in Figure 8.3.
Each row of the table includes a common shape with the centroid marked,
and simple formulas for determining the x- and y-coordinates of the
centroid and calculating the area of the shape.

\textbf{Figure 8.3:} Reproduction of one of the shapes in Appendix E.
Appendix E includes a sketch of the area with the centroid marked,
formulas for determining the x- and y-coordinates of the centroid, and a
formula for calculating the area of the shape.

Often, structural sections are combinations of these standard shapes
called composite sections. As long as we know the location of the
centroid of each shape that comprises the section, we will not need to
use integration to find the location of the overall sections' centroid.
We can use equations 8.1 and 8.2 in conjunction with the table in
Appendix E to find the location of the centroid for composite shapes.

Find the centroid of the shape below.

For this T-section, we notice that it is symmetric about the y-axis.
This means we will not need to calculate the centroid in the x direction
because we know it will be on that y-axis. We only need to find the
distance in the y direction, \(\bar{Y}\).

{[}figure{]}

The first thing we need to do is establish a coordinate system where the
origin is our reference point, RP. In this example we chose the bottom
left corner of the section so that all of our y distances will be
positive.

We then divide the section into simpler shapes where we know the
location of the centroid. In this case we chose two rectangles, labeled
1 and 2 in the figure.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}

2 & 13.5 & 5.25 & 70.875 \\
& \(\sum A\)=27 & & \(\sum A\bar{y}\)=101.25 \\
\end{longtable}

Next, we will create a table with columns titled Shape, \(A\)
(in.\textsuperscript{2}), \(\bar{y}\) (in.), and \(A\bar{y}\)
(in.\textsuperscript{3}). We have two shapes so there will be two rows
in our table. The first column, Area, is the area of the individual
shape. The second column, \(\bar{y}\), is the perpendicular distance in
the y-direction from the RP to the centroid of that shape. For example,
for shape 1 the \(\bar{y_1}\) would be half of 4.5 inches since the
bottom of shape 1 aligns with the RP. However, for shape 2 the
\(\bar{y_2}\) would be 4.5 inches plus one half of 1.5 inches. This is
because we need to ensure that we are measuring from the RP as
illustrated below.

\[
\bar{Y}=\frac{101.25{~in.^3}}{27{~in.^2}}=3.75{~in.} ~~\text{from bottom}
\]

{[}figure{]}

Finally, to calculate the centroid coordinates, we will utilize equation
8.2. by summing the last column and the second column in our table. We
found the centroid to be 3.75 inches from the reference point in the
y-direction and on the line of symmetry in the x-direction. The figure
below show the location of the centroid for this T section.

For this section, we notice that it is symmetric about the y-axis,
similar to the previous example. This means that we will not need to
calculate the centroid in the x direction because we know it will be on
that y-axis. We only need to find the distance in the y direction,
\(\bar{Y}\).

The first thing we need to do is establish a coordinate system whose
origin is our reference point, RP. In this example, we chose the bottom
of the section along the y-axis so that all of our y distances will be
positive.

We then divide the section into simpler shapes for which we know the
centroid's location. In this case, we chose three rectangles labeled 1,
2, and 3 in the figure.

Next, we will create a table with columns titled Shape, \(A\)
(mm\textsuperscript{2}), \(\bar{y}\) (mm), and \(A\bar{y}\)
(mm\textsuperscript{3}). We have three shapes, so there will be three
rows. The first column, Area, is the area of the individual shape. The
second column, \(\bar{y}\), is the perpendicular distance in the
y-direction from the RP to the centroid of that shape. The figure below
shows how the \(\bar{y}\) for each shape is calculated.

\[

This section does not have any axis of symmetry, so we will need to find
both the \(\bar{x}\) and the \(\bar{y}\). We first need to establish a
coordinate system whose origin is our reference point, RP. In this
example, we will use the coordinate axis in the problem to illustrate
when \(\bar{x}\) will be negative.

We then divide the section into simpler shapes for which we know the
centroid's location. In this case, we will break this up into the
square, triangle, and circle labeled 1, 2, and 3 in the figure. Note
that the circle is a hole, and the area will be represented as negative.

To find the location of the centroid of a composite section where the

section, use the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Establish a coordinate axis where the origin is the reference point
  (RP). This will be where the centroid will be measured.
\item
  Break the overall section up into simpler shapes where the location of
  the centroid of each shape is known. It is helpful here to sketch
  this. If the section has a hole, include the hole as a shape with a
  negative area. Remember to take advantage of symmetry. If the overall
  section is symmetric about an axis, you already know the location of
  the centroid in that direction as it is on that axis.
\item
  Determine the Area (A), the perpendicular distance from the y-axis
  (\(\bar{x}\)), and the perpendicular distance from the x-axis
  (\(\bar{y}\)) to the centroid of each shape. As sections become more
  complex, it might be advantageous to arrange these values in tabular
  form (see examples in this section).
\item
  Apply Equations 8.1 and 8.2 to find the overall section's centroid,
  (\(\bar{X}, \bar{Y}\)). Remember that this location is measured from
  the RP you established in step 1.
\item
  Check that your answer is reasonable. Imagine any straight line that
  passes through the centroid. There should be an equal amount of area
  on each side of this line. Mark the centroid location on the composite
  area and check that this appears roughly accurate.

\section{\texorpdfstring{2\textsuperscript{nd} Moment of
Areas}{2nd Moment of Areas}}\label{sec-8.2}

Click to expand

Another important geometric property needed to calculate stresses in
beams is the Moment of Inertia of the Area (2\textsuperscript{nd} moment
of area). Similar to our discussion of centroids, you likely were
presented this topic in Statics so this chapter is designed to be a
review. By definition, the second moment of area or moment of inertia
depicted in Figure 8.4 is defined as:

\[
I_x=\int_A y^2 d A
\]

\[
I_y=\int_A x^2 d A
\]

\[
I_z=J=\int_A r^2 d A
\]

\textbf{Figure 8.4:} Moments of inertia of an area dA.

In this text, we will use common shapes or a composite of common shapes
for our cross-sections. Appendix E includes formulas to calculate the
moment of inertia. Part of Appendix E is reproduced in figure 8.5. Each
row of the table includes a common shape with the centroid marked, and
formulas for determining the moment of inertia of the area about the x-,
y-, and z-centroidal axes. Note that these equations are valid only for
the axes passing through the centroid of the area and are written as
\(\overline{I_{x^{\prime}}}\), \(\overline{I_{y^{\prime}}}\), and J
respectively. The bar notation is used to signify that the moment of
inertia is being calculated around the centroidal axes.

\textbf{Figure 8.5:} Reproduction of one of the shapes in Appendix E.
Appendix E includes a sketch of the area with the centroid marked, and
formulas for determining the moment of inertia of the area about the x-,
y-, and z-centroidal axes.

As noted previously, structural sections are often combinations of these
standard shapes called composite sections. Similar to calculating
centroids we will break these composite sections into common shapes and
find the moment of inertia of these individual shapes.~ When we
calculate each individual shape's moment of inertia, we need to ensure
that they are all about the same axis. The \textbf{parallel axis
theorem} provides a method for calculating the moment of inertia of an
area about an axis parallel to an axis passing through the centroid,
given that the moment of inertia about the latter axis is known.

To establish the parallel axis theorem, we will examine the moment of
inertia \emph{I} of an area \emph{A} relative to an axis \emph{x}, as
illustrated in Figure 8.6.

\textbf{Figure 8.6:} The moment of inertia of an area A about an axis
\emph{x} can be derived from its moment of inertia about the centroidal
axis \emph{x'} through a computation involving the distance dy between
the axes.

The centroid of the area is at C, where the x'-y' axis is drawn; note
that x' is parallel to x and y' is parallel to y. The x-y' axes will be
termed the centroidal axes and a distance of dx and dy from the x-y
axes, respectively. The distance between the element dA and the x'-axis
is denoted as y'. Now we have \(y=y^{\prime}+d_y\). Substituting into
equation 8.3, we have:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& I_x=\int\left(y^{\prime}+d_y\right)^2 d A \\
& I_x=\int\left(y^{\prime}\right)^2 d A+2 d_y \int y^{\prime} d A+d_y^2 \int d A
\end{aligned}
\]

The first integral represents the moment of inertia about the centroidal
axis x'. The second integral is zero since the centroid is located on
the x' axis (i.e., \(\int y^{\prime} d A\) represents the first moment
of area about the x' centroidal axis, which is zero as discussed in
section 8.1). The last integral represents the total area, A. So we
have:

\[
I_x=\overline{I_{x^{\prime}}}+A d_y^2
\]

A similar process is used to find an expression for I\textsubscript{y}:

\[
I_y=\overline{I_{y^{\prime}}}+A d_x^2
\]

Where:

I\textsubscript{x}, I\textsubscript{y} = the moment of inertia of an
area with respect to a given axis {[}m\textsuperscript{4},
in\textsuperscript{4}{]}

\(\overline{I_{x^{\prime}}}\) , \(\overline{I_{y^{\prime}}}\)= moment of
inertia of that area with respect to a parallel axis passing through the
centroid of the area {[}m\textsuperscript{4}, in\textsuperscript{4}{]}

A = area {[}m\textsuperscript{2}, in\textsuperscript{2}{]}

d\textsubscript{x}, d\textsubscript{y} = perpendicular distance between
the given axis and the parallel centroidal axis {[}m, in{]}

While the parallel axis theorem can be used to calculate the area moment
of inertia around any pair of axes, we will primarily focus on
calculating the area moment of inertia around the centroidal axes of a
composite area. It is this term which will be used in chapters 9 and 10
when calculating bending stresses and shear stresses.

We found that the centroid is located 3.75 inches from the bottom of the
section. The next step is to break the section into common shapes as
noted in the figure below.

The formulas for moment of inertia of each shape are with respect to the
shape's centroid not the overall section's centroid. We will need to
make and adjustment using the parallel-axis theorem to transform the
rotational axis from the shape's centroid to the section's centroid. We
will present this method in terms of a table.

Since we want to find the moment of inertia in the x and y directions
with respect to the section's centroid, we first need to calculate the
centroid. We did this in Example 8.3, the results are shown below.

{[}figure{]}

We found that the centroid is located 3.43 inches to the left of the
y-axis and 4.43 inches up from the x-axis. The next step is to break the
section into common shapes as noted in the figure below. Notice that
shape 3 is a hole so we will need to subtract the moment of inertia and
area.

{[}figure{]}

The formulas for moment of inertia of each shape are with respect to the
shape's centroid not the overall section's centroid. We will need to
make and adjustment using the parallel-axis theorem to transform the
rotational axis from the shape's centroid to the section's centroid.~ We
will present this method in terms of a table, first for
I\textsubscript{x} then I\textsubscript{y}.

Beams are structural members that support loads along their length.
Typically, these loads are perpendicular to the axis of the beam and
cause only shear forces and bending moments.

\textbf{Figure 9.1 Overarching book figure} \,

As we found in previous chapters, internal forces and moments and
section properties are crucial to calculating stresses and deflections.
The same is true for finding stresses and deflections in beams. This
chapter describes calculating bending stresses in beams, such as those
in Figure 9.2, with considerations for unsymmetric bending and beam
design.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4.89583in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Figure 9.2.jpg}

landscaped bicycle and pedestrian bridge in Seattle.}

\section{Bending Stress}\label{sec-9.1}

Click to expand

This section will discuss bending behavior of straight, symmetric,
homogeneous beams. This section will be limited to beams that have a
cross section that is symmetric with an axis and the bending moment is
around an axis that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. Examine
the initially unaltered beam depicted in Figure 9.3, characterized by a
rectangular cross-section, and annotated with both horizontal and
vertical grid lines.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=2.89583in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Figure 9.3.png}

}

\caption{Figure 9.3: An unloaded beam with a rectangular cross-section.}

\end{figure}%

Upon the application of a bending moment, the tendency emerges to deform
these lines, conforming to the pattern illustrated in Figure 9.4.
Observe the curvature of the horizontal lines, and note that the
vertical lines, while maintaining straightness, undergo a rotation. The
application of a bending moment induces stretching in the material at
the bottom section of the bar and compression in the material at the top
section. As a result, within the transitional zone between these two
regions, there exists a surface known as the \textbf{neutral surface},
where the horizontal fibers of the material experience no change in
length (no compression or tension). When viewed on a cross-section, the
neutral surface appears as a horizontal line known as the
\textbf{neutral axis}.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=2.92708in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Figure 9.4.png}

}

\caption{Figure 9.4: The deformation of the beam in Figure 9.3 when
subjected to a symmetric bending moment.}

\end{figure}%

We can make a similar observation when a kids toy undergoes bending as
shown in Figure 9.5. This toy is subjected to a bending moment in the
opposite direction of the beam in Figure 9.4, this will switch the
behavior of the top and the bottom surfaces. Notice in Figure 9.5 the
fibers at the top are pulled apart while the bottom surface fibers are
pushed together.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.35417in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Figure 9.5.jpg}

}

\caption{Figure 9.5: The distortion of a kid's toy when undergoing
bending.}

\end{figure}%

We can take this knowledge about deformations due to bending and apply
it to the failure of the column in Figure 9.6. Notice that the column
was fixed at the base and was subjected to a transverse force that
caused failure. The fibers on the right side of the column failure point
were pulled apart while the fibers on the left side of the column
failure point were compressed.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4.23958in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Figure 9.6.jpg}

}

\caption{Figure 9.6: Column failure due to bending.}

\end{figure}%

We will make the following assumptions about deformations due to
bending:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There must be a neutral surface parallel to both the upper and lower
  surfaces, where the length remains constant.
\item
  Throughout the deformation, all cross sections of the beam remain plan
  and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis.
\item
  The cross section will keep it's shape, we will ignore the Poisson
  effects discussed in chapter 4 of this text.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.40625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Figure 9.7.png}

}

\caption{Figure 9.7: Element in beam bending.}

\end{figure}%

To understand bending stress in a beam subjected to arbitrary loads,
examine a small element extracted from the beam in Figure 9.7. The
derivation of the bending strain equation remains unaffected by the beam
type or specific loads. Remember the fundamental definition of normal
strain:

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{\delta}{L}
\]

We can use this to calculate the normal strain along AB in our beam.

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{\overline{A^{\prime} B^{\prime}}-\overline{A B}}{\overline{A B}}
\]

Distance y is measured relative to the neutral surface and is positive
above the neutral surface and negative below. Prior to bending, the line
AB is the same length at all values of y. However, when bending occurs,
the length of A'B' varies. The length A'B' experiences a reduction in
length as the section moves farther above the neutral surface, and
conversely, it undergoes an increasing extension below the neutral
surface. By definition, the length of the neutral surface doesn't change
and remains the same as length AB. We can describe the lengths AB and
A'B' using the radius of curvature (ρ) and the differential angle (dθ)
shown in Figure 9.7.

\[
\begin{gathered}
\overline{A B}=\rho d \theta \\
\overline{A^{\prime} B^{\prime}}=(\rho-y) d \theta
\end{gathered}
\]

We can now substitute these lengths into our strain equation:

\[
\varepsilon=\frac{(\rho-y) d \theta-\rho d \theta}{\rho d \theta}
\]

Simplifying

\[
\begin{gathered}
\varepsilon=\frac{\rho d \theta-y d \theta-\rho d \theta}{\rho d \theta} \\
\varepsilon=\frac{-y d \theta}{\rho d \theta} \\
\varepsilon=-\frac{y}{\rho}
\end{gathered}
\]

This relationship shows us that the longitudinal strain, ε, varies
lineraly with the distance, y, from the neutral surface. The maximum
stress occurs at the outermost fibers, extreme top and bottom of the
section. We call this maximum distance from the netrual surface, c.~We
can now write a relationship for the maximum absolute value of the
strain, ε\textsubscript{m}.

\[
\begin{gathered}
\frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_{\max }}=-\frac{y / \rho}{c / \rho} \\
\varepsilon=-\left(\frac{y}{c}\right) \varepsilon_{\max }
\end{gathered}
\]

Assuming that our material behaves in a linearly elastic manner, we can
use Hooke's Law, \(\sigma = E \epsilon\), to rewrite the strain
relationship above into a relationship of stresses:

\[
\sigma=-\left(\frac{y}{c}\right) \sigma_{\max }
\]

Therefore, similar to the variation in normal strain, normal stress, σ,
will fluctuate from zero at the neutral surface to a maximum value,
σ\textsubscript{max}, at a distance c from the neutral surface as shown
in Figure 9.8.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.52083in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Figure 9.8.png}

}

\caption{Figure 9.8: Bending stress variation.}

\end{figure}%

To determine the position of the neutral surface, we necessitate the
condition where the resultant force generated by the stress distribution
across the cross-sectional area is equal to zero.

\[
0=\int_A F_{\text {resultant }}=\int_A \sigma d A
\]

We can now substitute our previous relationship between stress and
distance from neutral axis.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& 0=\int_A-\left(\frac{y}{c}\right) \sigma_{\max } d A \\
& 0=-\frac{\sigma_{\max }}{c} \int_A y d A
\end{aligned}
\]

Since \(-\frac{\sigma_{\max }}{c}\) does not equal zero we are left
with:

\[
0=\int_A y d A
\]

This integral represents the first moment of area, as discussed in
section 8.1. This equation indicates that the first moment of the
cross-section about its neutral axis must be zero. Recall that the
location of the centroid was determined by
\(\bar{y}=\frac{\int_A y d A}{A}\). Consequently, for a member
experiencing pure bending and as long as the stresses remain within the
elastic range, the neutral axis traverses through the centroid of the
section since \(\bar{y}\) (the distance from the neutral axis to the
centroid) is zero.

We can ascertain the stress in the beam by setting the moment M equal to
the moment produced by the stress distribution around the neutral axis.

\[
d M=y d F
\]

Since

\[
d F=\sigma d A
\]

We can write

\[
\begin{gathered}
M=\int_A y d F=\int_A y(\sigma d A)=\int_A y\left(-\frac{y}{c} \sigma_{\max }\right) d A \\
M=\frac{\sigma_{\max }}{c} \int_A y^2 d A
\end{gathered}
\]

You might notice that the integral, \(\int_A y^2 d A\), represents the
moment of inertia, or second moment of area, of the cross-sectional area
about the neutral axis. We will denote the moment of inertia with
\textbf{I}. This topic was covered in Section 8.2 of this text if you
need a review.

Rearranging the previous equation to obtain the \textbf{flexure
formula}:

\[
\sigma_{\max }=\frac{M c}{I}
\]

Where:

σ\textsubscript{max} = the maximum normal stress in the beam, note that
a complete description includes magnitude, units, tension, or
compression {[}Pa, psi{]}

M = the internal moment calculated about the neutral axis of the cross
section, determined from method of sections or shear and moment diagrams
{[}N·m, lb·in.{]}

c = the perpendicular distance from the neutral axis to the point the
farthest away from the neutral axis {[}m, in.{]}

I = the moment of inertial or second moment of area about the neutral
axis {[}m\textsuperscript{4}, in.\textsuperscript{4}{]}

We know from previous derivation that:

\[
\sigma=-\left(\frac{y}{c}\right) \sigma_{\max }
\]

we can rearrange to provide the following relationship:

\[
\frac{\sigma_{\max }}{c}=-\frac{\sigma}{y}
\]

We can determine a similar flexure formula to calculate the bending
stress at any point along the cross section:

\[
\sigma=-\frac{M y}{I}
\]

Similar to chapter 2, when reporting normal stress you include if that
stress is in tension or compression. During the derivation, we used a
beam that was bending concave upwards. In chapter 7 we indicated that
this type of moment was considered positive. This leads to compression
above the neutral axis and tension below. The inverse is true when the
beam is subjected to negative bending moment as shown in Figure 9.9.

\begin{figure}[H]

We first start with the internal moment, this is a given in the problem
statement to be +50k-in. Positive moment indicates that the beam is
bending concave up, compression above the neutral axis and tension
below.

We next need to determine the beam properties---centroid and moment of
inertia. Since this is not a standard shape and the shape is not
symmetric in the y direction, we will need to calculate this by hand. We
cover this shape in detail in chapter 8.

There are three parts to this problem that change the y value. We will
start with calculating the stress at the top of the section, using the
flexure formula:

\[
\sigma_{t o p}=-\frac{M y}{I}
\]

Before we plug in our values, we need to ensure that the units are
consistent.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(M = 50{~kip}\cdot{in.}\)
\item
  \(y = 2.25{~in.}\)
\item
  \(I = 86.0625{~in.^4}\)
\end{itemize}

Since all units are in kips and inches, we are going to plug into our
flexure formula:

\[
\sigma_{top}=-\frac{(50{~kip}\cdot{in.})(2.25{~in.})}{86.0625{~in.}^4}=-1.31{~ksi}
\]

For a complete answer we need to include magnitude, units, and tension
or compression. The magnitude is 1.31, the units will be
kips/in\textsuperscript{2} or ksi. To determine the tension or
compression we will look at the sign of the internal moment and where
along the section we are calculating the bending stress. In our example
the moment is positive, and we calculate the stress at the top of the
section our answer will be in compression.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.79167in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.1 part 4.png}
\end{center}

\[
\sigma_{top}=1.31{~ksi}~(C)
\]

Note that, as long as we are careful to use the correct signs for M and
y (both positive in this case), the answer will also come out with the
correct sign (negative in this case which indicates compression).

We will now calculate the normal stress at the bottom of the beam. The
only quantity that changes is the y value -- we will now use the
distance from the neutral axis to the bottom of the beam (3.75 in).

\[
\sigma_{btm}=-\frac{(50{~kip}\cdot{in.})(-3.75{~in.})}{86.0625{~in.}^4}=2.18{~ksi}
\]

The moment is positive, so the beam bends concave up, anything below the
neutral axis is in tension.

\[
\sigma_{btm}=2.18{~ksi}~(T)
\]

This again works mathematically as long as we use the correct positive
sign for the M and negative sign for y (since the point of interest is
below the neutral axis). The answer comes out positive, indicating
tension and matching our expectation.

Finally, we can calculate the normal stress at the junction of the
flange and the web. We will need to find the distance from the neutral
axis the flange web junction.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.67708in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.1 part 6.png}
\end{center}

\[
\sigma_{F / w}=-\frac{(50{~kip}\cdot{in.})(0.75{~in.})}{86.0625{~in.}^4}=-0.436{~ksi}
\]

Since the flange web junction is above the neutral axis and our beam is
subjected to positive moment, our bending stress will be in compression.

\[
\sigma_{F/w}=0.436{~ksi}~(C)
\]

The first step is to find the internal forces in the beam so that we can
find the maximum positive and negative moments. The best way to do this
is to draw the moment diagram. We did this in detail in Example 7.3.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.8125in,height=\textheight]{images/clipboard-191172276.png}
\end{center}

We can see that the maximum positive moment is 37.125 kN·m and the
maximum negative moment is 30 kN·m.

We next need to determine the beam's geometric properties---centroid and
moment of inertia. Since this is not a standard shape and the shape is
not symmetric in the y direction, we will need to calculate this by
hand. We covered this shape in detail in Example 8.2 {[}text - link to
centroid and moment of inertia example in ch 8{]}

The positive bending moment will cause compression at the top of the
cross-section and tension at the bottom. The negative bending moment
will cause tension at the top and compression at the bottom. It's not
obvious by inspection which of these two tensile stresses will be
larger, nor which of the two compressive stresses will be larger. We
should calculate all four to compare.

Before we plug in our values, we need to ensure that the units are
consistent so we will change everything to Newtons and meters.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  M\textsubscript{pos} = 37.125 kN·m = 37.125 x 10\textsuperscript{3}
  N·m
\item
  M\textsubscript{neg} = 30 kN·m = 30 x 10\textsuperscript{3} N·m
\item
  y\textsubscript{top} = 89.43 mm = 0.08943 m
\item
  y\textsubscript{btm} = 130.57 mm = 0.13057 m
\item
  I\textsubscript{x} = 90,862,095 mm\textsuperscript{4} = 90.862095 x
  10\textsuperscript{-6} m\textsuperscript{4}
\end{itemize}

We will start with calculating the stress at the top and bottom of the
section due to the maximum positive moment, using the flexure formula:

\[ \sigma=-\frac{M y}{I} \]

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.89583in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.2 part 6.png}
\end{center}

\[ \sigma_{top/pos}=-\frac{\left(37.125 \times 10^3{~N}\cdot{m}\right)(0.0893 {~m})}{90.86 \times 10^{-6}{~m}^4}=-36.49{~MPa~(C)} \]

\[ \sigma_{btm/pos}=-\frac{\left(37.125\times10^3{~N}\cdot{m}\right)(-0.13057{~m})}{90.86 \times 10^{-6}{~m}^4}=53.35{~MPa}{~(T)} \]

Now we can do something similar for the maximum negative bending stress.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.72917in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.2 part 7.png}
\end{center}

\[ \sigma_{top/neg}=-\frac{\left(-30 \times 10^3{~N}\cdot{m}\right)(0.0893{~m})}{90.86 \times 10^{-6}{~m}^4}=29.48{~MPa~(T)} \]

\[ \sigma_{btm/neg}=-\frac{\left(-30 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~N}\cdot{m}\right)(-0.13057{~m})}{90.86 \times 10^{-6}{~m}^4}=-43.11{~MPa}~{(C)} \]

The overall maximum tensile stress for this beam occurs at the bottom of
the section due to positive moment, 53.35 MPa (T). The overall maximum
compressive stress (43.11 MPa (C)) also occurs at the bottom of the
section in a different part of the beam, but is due to the negative
moment.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

For many situations the overall largest stress would be sufficient.
However, there are materials that behave differently depending on
whether they are subjected to tensile or compressive stress. Concrete is
a good example of this, as it is relatively strong against compressive
stresses but very weak against tensile stresses. Steel rebar is placed
inside concrete members to support the tensile stresses as shown in
Figure 9.10. At this point in your engineering career it is good
practice to report both the maximum tensile and compressive stresses at
each critical point on the beam.

\section{Beam Design for Bending}\label{sec-9.2}

Click to expand

Frequently, beam design is governed by the bending moment. In this
section, we will leverage our understanding of bending stress to design
beams capable of withstanding their applied internal moments. We will
design two common categories of beams. We'll start with rolled steel
beams of varying cross sections. You can find a sampling of these
standard shapes in Appendix A of this text. We'll then discuss
rectangular cross-sections, which are common for timber beams.

A safe design requires that the allowable stress of the material used is
greater than the stress due to the loading. When we design a structure,
we need to know what the material properties are so that we can produce
safe designs. In the flexure equation for maximum bending stress,
\(\sigma_m=\frac{M_{\max } c}{I}\), there are four variables:
σ\textsubscript{m}, M\textsubscript{max}, c, and I. We will start with
the allowable stress of the material, σ\textsubscript{all}, and use the
\textbar M\textsubscript{max}\textbar{} derived from the loading
condition. What is left are section properties, I, and c.~For standard
shapes these are combined into one variable, section modulus (S):

\[
S=\frac{I}{c}
\]

We can substitute this value into the flexure formula and rearrange for
S\textsubscript{min}---the minimum allowable value of the section
modulus for the beam:

\[
S_{\text {min }}=\frac{\left|M_{\max }\right|}{\sigma_{\text {all }}}
\]

\subsection{Design of Standard Steel
Sections}\label{design-of-standard-steel-sections}

As long as we design our beam such that its section modulus is larger
than S\textsubscript{min}, the beam is guaranteed not to fail due to
bending stress. Rolled steel beams tend to have relatively complex
cross-sections with multiple dimensions that can be varied in order to
alter its section modulus and therefore its resistance to bending
stress. Designing each dimension individually would be time consuming
and it would be costly to manufacture a unique beam for every loading
condition. Instead, beams are mass produced in standard sizes and
engineers simply select the most appropriate beam for their specific
need. There will be many standard steel shapes that will satisfy this
equation, meaning they will be safe. Engineering is determining which of
the shapes that work you will use. Often there are many criteria that
you will need to consider. In this section we will use cost to determine
the shape. Steel beams are priced by their weight, the higher the weight
the more expensive. To choose the most economical shape, we will choose
the shape with the smallest weight (smallest cross-sectional area).

There are basic structural steel shapes that have standardized cross
sectional dimensions. W shapes (standing for Wide Flange) are often used
for beam design as they have an efficient cross section. Figure 9.11 is
a sample of the beam table in the Appendix.

\textbf{Figure 9.11: Portion of the W Section table from Appendix A}

Each beam has a designation that gives us quick information about the
section, see Figure 9.12.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.83333in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Figure 9.12.png}

}

\caption{Figure 9.12: Description of the Shape designation in U.S.
Customary Units.}

\end{figure}%

Notice in the sample beam section table in Figure 9.11 they are all W
shapes and grouped by approximate height (first number). Within each
height grouping the shapes are arranged from lightest to heaviest
(second number) when going from the bottom to top of the height
grouping. For each standard shape in this table the cross-sectional
area, depth (height), flange and web dimensions, moment of inertia in
the x and y directions, section modulus, in the x and y direction, and
the radius of gyration in the x and y directions (this is a geometric
property related to buckling, we will use this in chapter 15 of this
text) are given.

In certain instances, the selection of a section might be constrained by
factors such as the permissible depth of the cross-section or the
allowable deflection of the beam. This discussion is limited to
materials that behave the same in tension and compression. If this is
not the case (such as when you use concrete), then you may need to check
multiple points along the length of the beam. Additionally, if the
section is not symmetric about the neutral axis, the maximum tensile and
compressive stresses may not occur at the point where M is max or min.
Lastly, this procedure only considers bending stresses. Although bending
stresses do control the design of most beams, there are instances where
shear or deflection will control. We will discuss this more in chapter
11 in this text.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 9.3}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Knowing that the allowable normal stress for the steel used is 24 ksi,
select the most economical wide-flange beam to support the loading
shown.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.79167in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.3 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The first step is to find the internal forces in the beam, we will start
by calculating the reactions.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.80208in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.3 part 2.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum& F_x =A_x =0\\
\sum& M_A =-8{~kips}(5{~ft})+5{~kips}(11{~ft})-(3\frac{kips}{ft}*6{~ft})(17{~ft})+B_y(20{~ft})=0 \\
&B_y =14.55{~kips} \\
\sum& F_y=A_y-8{~kips}+5{~kips}-(3\frac{kips}{ft})*6{~ft})+14.55{~kips}=0 \\
&A_y=6.45{~kips}
\end{aligned}
\]

Now that we have the reactions, we can build the shear diagram. We will
start on the left side and go up the reaction at support A, 6.45 kips.
We will continue along the beam following the loads to finish the shear
diagram.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.66667in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.3 part 3.png}
\end{center}

To build the moment diagram we will calculate the area under the curve
from the shear diagram using geometry. We will calculate the area of
three rectangles and two triangles.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& A_1=(6.45)(5)=32.25 \\
& A_2=(1.55)(6)=9.3 \\
& A_3=(3.45)(3)=10.35 \\
& \frac{18}{6}=\frac{3.45}{x} \quad \therefore \text{ x}=1.15 \text{ ft, } \text{ y}=6-1.15=4.85 \text{ ft} \\
& A_4=\frac{1}{2}(1.15)(3.45)=1.98 \\
& A_5=\frac{1}{2}(4.85)(1455)=35.28 \\
&
\end{aligned}
\]

From the moment diagram we can see that
\textbar M\textsubscript{max}\textbar{} = 35.28 kip*ft. We will use this
value and σ\textsubscript{all} = 24 ksi (given in the problem statement)
to calculate the minimum section modulus needed,
\emph{S\textsubscript{min}}.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& S_{min}=\frac{|M_\text{max}|}{\sigma_\text{all}} \\
& S_{min}=\frac{(35.28{~kip}\cdot{ft})(12\frac{in.}{ft})}{24{~ksi}} \\
& S_{min}=17.64{~in}^3
\end{aligned}
\]

Now that we know the minimum section modulus needed for this beam, we
will go to the standard beam table in Appendix A. Focusing on the
S\textsubscript{x} column, we will start at the bottom of the table and
choose one shape from each height section that is applicable.

For our beam, the following sections will be adequate for bending:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  W8 x 21
\item
  W10 x 19
\item
  W12 x 22
\item
  W14 x 22
\end{itemize}

We didn't choose any from the W4, W5, and W6 groupings because none of
these beams have a section modulus greater than 17.64
in\textsuperscript{3}. We also didn't continue with groupings greater
than W14 because those sections are far larger than what we need as
noted by the weight (second number in the designation).

Now we will choose the most economical beam by comparing the last number
in the designation, as this represents the weight per foot of the beam.
The most economical section for this material and loading is the
\textbf{W10 x 19}. This beam weighs 19 lb/ft and is the lightest of the
beams we identified.

  Establish the allowable stress, σ\textsubscript{all}, value of sigma

  select one beam in each height section (if applicable). Then from this
  short list, choose the section with the smallest weight per unit
  length, as it represents the most economical option for which S
  \textbf{≥} S\textsubscript{min}. It's essential to note that this
  choice may not necessarily correspond to the section with the smallest
  S value.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Design of Rectangular
Sections}\label{design-of-rectangular-sections}

Rectangular cross-sections are common for timber beams. There are only
two dimensions that need to be specified, base and height. While there
are standard rectangular cross-sections too (e.g., 2'' x 4'') we'll
approach the design of rectangular cross-sections by assuming that one
dimension scales with the other and so we only need to specify a single
dimension. Rather than select from a list of standard cross-sections,
we'll specify this required dimension exactly.

We can calculate the minimum section modulus as before

\[
S_{\text {min }}=\frac{\left|M_{\text {max }}\right|}{\sigma_{\text {all }}}
\]

Now set this value

\[
S_{\text {min }}=\frac{I}{c}
\]

For a rectangle

\[
\begin{gathered}
I=\frac{b h^3}{12} \\
c=\frac{h}{2}
\end{gathered}
\]

So

\[
S_{\text {min }}=\frac{I}{c}=\frac{2 b h^3}{12 h}=\frac{b h^2}{6}
\]

Problems will be set up such that there is a relationship between b and
h, which leaves only one unknown that can be solved for directly. This
will be the minimum acceptable size for this dimension---anything larger
than the calculated value will not fail due to bending stress.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 9.4}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A simply supported timber beam spans a gap of 10 m. It is subjected to a
uniform distributed load w = 15 kN/m as shown. The beam has a
rectangular cross-section and will be manufactured such that the height
is 2x the base. Determine the minimum acceptable dimensions for the
cross-section of this beam if the maximum allowable bending stress of
the timber is 12 MPa.

The allowable stress is given as σ\textsubscript{all} = 12 MPa.
Determine the magnitude of the maximum internal bending moment by
drawing the shear force and bending moment diagrams. Since the loading
is symmetric, the total applied load of 15 * 10 = 150 kN will be split
evenly between the two supports. The reaction force at each support will
be 75 kN.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.45833in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.4 part 2.png}
\end{center}

The magnitude of the maximum internal bending moment
\textbar M\textsubscript{max}\textbar{} = 187.5 kN·m

Now we can determine the required section modulus. Be careful with the
order of magnitude of the bending moment and allowable stress.

\[
S_\text{min}=\frac{187.5\times10^3{~N}\cdot{m}}{12\times10^6\frac{N}{m^2}}=0.015625{~m}^3
\]

We can use this value to determine the required dimensions of the
cross-section. Recall that h = 2b for this beam.

\[
\begin{gathered}
S_{min}=0.015625{~m^3}=\frac{b h^2}{6}=\frac{b(2 b)^2}{6}=\frac{4 b^3}{6}=\frac{2}{3} b^3 \\
b^2=\frac{3}{2} * 0.015625{~m^3}=0.0234375{~m^3} \\
b=~^3\sqrt{0.0234375}=0.286{~m} \\
b=286{~mm} \\
h=2b=2 * 286=572{~mm}
\end{gathered}
\]

The minimum required dimensions to ensure this beam doesn't fail due to
bending stress are b = 286 mm and h = 572 mm.

For the purposes of this text, it is appropriate to give exact answers
to 3 significant figures. In practice we wouldn't generally specify the
required dimension down to the mm since this is unnecessarily precise to
manufacture. It is more practical to design to perhaps the nearest 10
mm, remembering to always round up. For example, we calculated the
required dimension b = 153 mm. We must not round this down to 150 mm as
this are below the required value, but rounding up to 160 mm would be
acceptable. While not included in this problem, there would also be a
factor of safety (Section~\ref{sec-4.8}) included in all designs in
practice.

\section{Unsymmetric Bending---Moment Arbitrarily
Applied}\label{sec-9.3}

Click to expand

Occasionally, a member may experience loading where the bending moment,
M, does not align with one of the principal axes of the cross-section.
In such cases, it is advisable to initially resolve the moment into
components along the principal axes. Subsequently, the flexure formula
can be applied to ascertain the normal stress induced by each moment
component. Finally, by employing the principle of superposition, the
resultant normal stress at the specific point can be determined.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH9 PNGs/Figure 9.13.png}

}

\caption{Figure 9.13: Moment arbitrarily applied to a rectangular cross
section.}

\end{figure}%

To systematize this process, envision a beam with a rectangular
cross-section subjected to a moment, \textbf{M}, as depicted in Figure
9.13(a). Here, \textbf{M} forms an angle, θ, with the maximum principal
z-axis, which is the axis of maximum moment of inertia for the
cross-section. It is assumed that θ is positive when directed from the
positive z-axis towards the positive y-axis. We can resolve \textbf{M}
into y and z components:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& M_z=M \cos \theta \\
& M_y=M \sin \theta
\end{aligned}
\]

We can see in Figure 9.13 (b) the components of M acting on the
rectangular cross section. It is important to keep track of which side
of the beam is in compression and tension when subjected to both
M\textsubscript{z} and M\textsubscript{y}. We will use tensile stress as
positive and compressive stress as negative. When we look at a
+M\textsubscript{z} we can see that this moment causes the top of the
section to be in compression and the bottom of the section to be in
tension. When we inspect the section when subjected to
+M\textsubscript{y}, we can see that the left side will be in tension
while the right side will be in compression. Combining what we know
about the sign convention with the flexure formula we can calculate the
resultant normal stress at any point on the cross section using the
following equation:

\[
\sigma=-\frac{M_z y}{I_z}+\frac{M_y z}{I_y}
\]

Note that for the signs to work correctly we must assign the appropriate
sign to the y and z values and to the components of the bending moment.
These values are measured from the coordinate system that originates at
the centroid where the x axis is coming out of the page. You can also
ignore all of the signs and use your spatial awareness to determine if
each term is in tension or compression due to the applied moment.

Previously we identified the neutral axis---a line marking points of
zero stress, When the bending moment acted around the horizontal axis,
the neutral axis was also horizontal and passed through the centroid of
the cross-section. When the bending moment acts at an angle (θ) from the
horizontal axis, the neutral axis will still pass through the centroid
but it will not be horizontal. It too will be at an angle (α). We can
now determine the orientation of the neutral axis, as this will commonly
not coincide with the axis of bending moment. We can derive the
orientation of the neutral axis by setting the previous normal stress
equation equal to zero:

\[
0=-\frac{M_z y}{I_z}+\frac{M_y z}{I_y}
\]

Now we can rearrange this to solve for y.

\[
y=\frac{M_y I_z}{M_z I_y} z
\]

Now we can put this equation in terms of M by using
\(M_z=M \cos \theta\) and \(M_y=M \sin \theta\) to obtain:

\[
y=\left(\frac{I_z}{I_y} \tan \theta\right) z
\]

Since the slope of the line is \(\tan \alpha=y / z\) where the angle α
represents the angle the neutral axis forms with the z axis and can be
written as:

\[
\tan \alpha=y / z
\]

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 9.5}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A bending moment M = 400 kip⸱in. is applied around an axis 65° above the
negative z-axis as shown. Determine the bending stress at corners A, B,
C, and D. Also determine the orientation of the neutral axis with
respect to the z-axis.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.27083in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.5 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

We first determine the components of the bending moment around the y-
and z-axes:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& M_y=-400 \sin(65^{\circ})=-362.5{~kip}\cdot{in.} \\
& M_z=-400 \cos(65^{\circ})=-322.6{~kip}\cdot{in.}
\end{aligned}
\]

We'll also need the area moment of inertia around both axes:

\[
\begin{gathered}
I_y=\frac{8 * 15^3}{12}=2250{~in.}^4 \\
I_z=\frac{15 * 8^3}{12}=640{~in.}^4
\end{gathered}
\]

Now we can calculate the stress at each corner using

\[
\sigma=-\frac{M_z y}{I_z}+\frac{M_y z}{I_y}
\]

Pay close attention to the signs used for each term.

A:

\[
\sigma_A=-\frac{-322.6{~kip}\cdot{in.} *-4{~in.}}{640{~in.}^4}+\frac{-362.5{~kip}\cdot{in.} * 7.5{~in.}}{2250{~in.}^4}=-2.02{~ksi}-1.21{~ksi}=-3.23{~ksi}=3.23{~ksi}~(C)
\]

B:

\[
\sigma_B=-\frac{-322.6{~kip}\cdot{in.} * 4{~in.}}{640{~in.}^4}+\frac{-362.5{~kip}\cdot{in.} * 7.5{~in.}}{2250{~in.}^4}=2.02{~ksi}-1.21{~ksi}=0.810{~ksi}=0.810{~ksi }~(T)
\]

C:

\[
\sigma_C=-\frac{-322.6{~kip}\cdot{in.} * 4{~in.}}{640{~in.}^4}+\frac{-362.5{~kip}\cdot{in.} *-7.5{~in.}}{2250{~in.}^4}=2.02{~ksi}+1.21{~ksi}=3.23{~ksi}=3.23{~ksi}~(T)
\]

D:

\[
\sigma_D=-\frac{-322.6{~kip}\cdot{in.} *-4{~in.}}{640{~in.^4}}+\frac{-362.5{~kip}\cdot{in.} *-7.5{~in.}}{2250{~in.}^4}=-2.02{~ksi}+1.21{~ksi}=-0.810{~ksi}=0.810{~ksi}~(C)
\]

Note that due to the symmetry of the cross-section, the stresses at
diagonally opposite corners have the same magnitude but opposite signs.
This can be used to shorten the problem by only calculating the stresses
at two corners (say A and B) and identifying the stresses at the
opposite corners.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.20833in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.5 part 2.png}
\end{center}

The orientation of the neutral axis is found from:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\tan (\alpha)=\frac{I_z}{I_y} \tan (\theta) \\
\alpha=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{640{~in.}^4}{2250{~in.}^4} \tan \left(65^{\circ}\right)\right)=31.4^{\circ}
\end{gathered}
\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 9.6}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A bending moment M = 25 kip⸱ft is applied to a W14 x 43 beam around an
axis 40° above the positive z-axis as shown. Determine the maximum
tensile bending stress in the section and the orientation of the neutral
axis with respect to the z-axis.

\begin{center}

The dimensions of the W14 x 43 beam can be found in Appendix A. We can
also look up the area moment of inertia about both axes.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.26042in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.6 part 2.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{gathered}
I_y=45.2 \text{ in}^4 \\
I_z=428 \text{ in}^4
\end{gathered}
\]

Next determine the components of the bending moment around the y- and
z-axes. Since the bending moment is given in kip⸱ft and all of the
dimensions are given in inches, we'll convert the bending moment to
kip⸱in at this stage.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& M_y=25 \sin \left(40^{\circ}\right) * 12=193{~kip}\cdot{~in.} \\
& M_z=25 \cos \left(40^{\circ}\right) * 12=230{~kip}\cdot{~in.}
\end{aligned}
\]

The bending stress at any point can be calculated using:

\[
\sigma=-\frac{M_z y}{I_z}+\frac{M_y z}{I_y}
\]

The maximum tensile bending stress will occur at the corner where both
of these terms are positive. Since both M\textsubscript{z} and My are
positive, it should be apparent that the y-distance should be negative
and the z-distance should be positive, so the maximum tensile bending
stress will occur at the bottom left corner. At this point,
\(y=-\frac{13.7{~in.}}{2}=-6.85{~in.}\) and
\(z=\frac{8{~in.}}{2}=4{~in.}\).

\[
\sigma=-\frac{230{~kip}\cdot{in.} *-6.85{~in.}}{428{~in.}^4}+\frac{193{~kip}\cdot{in.} * 4{~in.}}{45.2{~in.}^4}=3.68{~ksi}+17.1{~ksi}=20.8{~ksi}~(T)
\]

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.16667in,height=\textheight]{images/CH9 PNGs/Example 9.6 part 3.png}
\end{center}

The orientation of the neutral axis is found from:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\tan (\alpha)=\frac{I_z}{I_y} \tan (\theta) \\
\alpha=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{428{~in.}^4}{45.2{~in.}^4} \tan \left(40^{\circ}\right)\right)=82.8^{\circ}

Beams under load will experience normal stresses that vary linearly
along the height of the cross section. Assuming that the material is
homogenous and linear elastic, the flexure formula can be used to
calculate the normal stresses. Care must be taken to ensure that bending
stresses are reported with magnitude units and tension/compression.

Engineers designing beams must consider the response of the beam to
bending stress, amongst other criteria. We start the design process in
this chapter by using the allowable stress and maximum moment to
determine the minimum section modulus. This minimum section modulus is
used to choose an adequate, economical beam shape. We will discuss
future chapters additional criteria to design a beam.

When a member experiences loading where the bending moment, M, does not
align with one of the principal axes of the cross-section, a method of
super position is used to determine the resultant normal stress at a
specific point. We can also calculate the orientation of the of the
neutral axis due to this unsymmetric loading.

\markright{Introduction}

In Chapter 9 we learned to calculate bending stresses in beams and how
to design beams to resist bending stress. The transverse loading applied
to beams will also create internal shear loads and therefore shear
stresses that must be calculated and accounted for (Figure 10.1).

\textbf{Figure 10.1:} A beam subjected to transverse loading will
experience both an internal bending moment and an internal shear force.

In this chapter, we'll first review an important geometric property
known as the first moment of area and demonstrate how to calculate it
for common beam cross-sections in Section 10.1. In Section 10.2 we'll
discuss shear stresses in beams and how to calculate them. In Section
10.3 we'll discuss shear flow, which is useful for beams with
cross-sections formed by joining two or more parts with fasteners such
as nails.

\section{The First Moment of Area}\label{sec-10.1}

Click to expand

Shear stress in an object depends on the internal shear force and the
shape of the cross-section. One important geometric property used in
this chapter is the first moment of area. This property was introduced
in section 8.1 and was used when determining the centroid of an area.
Recall we used equation 8.2 to break simple cross-sections down into a
number of composite parts. When finding the centroid of these composite
areas we modified the equation slightly to:

\[
\bar{y}=\frac{\sum y_i A_i}{\sum A_i}=\frac{y_1 A_1+y_2 A_2+\ldots}{A_1+A_2+\ldots}
\]

We can rewrite this equation in its integral form:

\[
\bar{y}=\frac{\int y d A}{\int d A}
\]

The numerator in this equation is the first moment of area. It will be
given the symbol Q.

\[
Q=\int y d A
\]

Similarly, for the purposes of this text we can write:

\[
Q=\sum y_i A_i=y_1 A_1+y_2 A_2+\ldots
\]

In Section~\ref{sec-8.1} we performed this calculation relative to some
convenient reference axis in order to determine the location of the
centroid of an area (such as in Example 8.3). A\textsubscript{i}
represents the area of each composite part and yi represents the
distance from the reference axis to the centroid of each composite part.

The first moment of area can actually be calculated around any axis. The
maximum value will always occur at the centroid of the cross-section
(i.e., the neutral axis) so many problems will involve finding the first
moment of area at the neutral axis, but there are also cases where
finding the first moment of area around some other axis is required.
Note that the axis should be perpendicular to the shear force, so a
vertical load requires us to use a horizontal axis.

To calculate the first moment of area around an axis, first draw a line
through this axis. We may choose to use either the area above this axis
or the area below it, whichever is simpler. The answer will be the same
either way. Break this area down into composite parts (if necessary) and
apply \(Q=\sum y_i A_i\) where A\textsubscript{i} is the area of each
composite part and y\textsubscript{i} is the perpendicular distance
between the centroid of the overall cross-section and the centroid of
each composite part. Note that we must first find the location of the
centroid of the overall cross-section in order to measure this distance.

Example 10.1 demonstrates this process to find the first moment of area
around the neutral axis of a T cross-section. This example is solved
twice, once using the area below the neutral axis and once using the
area above.

Example 10.2 uses the same cross-section and demonstrates calculating
the first moment of area around a different axis on the cross-section.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 10.1}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A beam has the T-shaped cross-section shown. Determine the first moment
of area around the neutral axis of the cross-section.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

First determine the y-coordinate of the centroid of the cross-section.
Consider the area as two rectangles and use the method of section 8.1.
We will choose a reference point at the bottom of the section to
calculate the centroid.

{[}figure{]}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& y_1=4.5{~in.}~,~ A_1=18{~in.}^2 \\
& y_2=10.5{~in.}~,~ A_2=30{~in.}^2 \\
& \bar{y}=\frac{(4.5{~in.} * 18{~in.}^2)+(10.5{~in.} * 30{~in.}^2)}{18{~in.}^2+30{~in.}^2}=8.25{~in.}~~\text{from the bottom of the section (our reference point) }
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that since this section is simple, only two shapes, we didn't
create a table as we did in chapter 8. This is a simplified version of
the table, but the calculation is exactly the same.

Now draw a horizontal line through the point of interest. In this case
the point of interest is the neutral axis. Use either the area above
this line or the area below this line to determine the first moment of
area around the neutral axis. We'll solve it both ways to demonstrate
that we get the same answer either way.

\textbf{Area below the neutral axis:}

{[}figure{]}

This area is a simple rectangle. Recall that \emph{Q=yA} where A is the
area of the rectangle and y is the vertical distance between the neutral
axis and the centroid of the rectangle.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& y=\frac{8.25{~in.}}{2}=4.125{~in.}  \\
& A=8.25{~in.} * 2{~in.}=16.5{~in} ^2 \\
& Q=y A=4.125{~in.} * 16.5{~in.}^2=68.1{~in.}^3
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{Area above the neutral axis:}

{[}figure{]}

This area can be split into two rectangles. Here we'll use
\(Q=\sum y_i A_i=y_1 A_1+y_2 A_2\)

\[
\begin{aligned}
& y_1=\frac{0.75{~in.}}{2}=0.375{~in.} \\

Whether we use the area above the neutral axis or the area below the
neutral axis, we get the same answer of Q=68.1 in\textsuperscript{3}. We
may choose to use whichever area seems simpler to work with.

We need to first determine the y-coordinate of the centroid of the cross
section. We did this in Example 10.1, the results are shown below.

\(\bar{y}=8.25{~in.}\) from the bottom of the cross-section.

Now draw a horizontal line through the point of interest. In this case
the point of interest is the seam between the two boards. As
demonstrated in Example 10.1, we may use either the area below this line
or the area above this line to determine the first moment of area.

\textbf{Area above the line:}

{[}figure{]}

This area is a simple rectangle. Recall that \emph{Q=yA} where A is the
area of the rectangle and y is the vertical distance between the neutral
axis and the centroid of the rectangle. Note that the perpendicular
distance is \textbf{always} measured to the neutral axis, not to the
seam between the two boards.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& y=0.75{~in.}+1.5{~in.}=2.25{~in.} \\
& A=10{~in.} * 3{~in.}=30{~in.}^2 \\
& Q=y A=2.25{~in.} * 30{~in.}^2=67.5{~in.}^3
\end{aligned}
\]

As an additional exercise, try using the area below the seam between the
two boards to calculate Q=67.5 in.\textsuperscript{3}.

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

Simple cross-sections such as rectangles and circles are fairly commonly
used for beams. For these simple cross-sections we can derive standard
solutions for the maximum first moment of area (Q\textsubscript{max}).
Recall that this always occurs at the neutral axis of the cross-section.

For a rectangle of base \emph{b} and height \emph{h} (Figure 10.2), the
neutral axis will be at \(y=\frac{h}{2}\). Drawing a line along the
neutral axis and taking the area above this line gives
\(A=b \frac{h}{2}\). The distance between the centroid of this area and
the neutral axis of the cross-section will be \(y=\frac{h}{4}\). Thus,
for a rectangular cross-section:

\[
Q_{\max }=\frac{h}{4} \frac{b h}{2}=\frac{b h^2}{8}
\]

\textbf{Figure 10.2:} Determining the first moment of area around the
neutral axis of a rectangular cross-section.

For a circular cross-section of radius r (Figure 10.3), the area above
the neutral axis is semi-circle so \(A=\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2\). The
distance from the centroid of the semi-circle to the neutral axis is
\(y=\frac{4 r}{3 \pi}\). Thus, for a circular cross-section:

\[
Q_{\max }=\frac{4 r}{3 \pi} \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2=\frac{2}{3} r^3
\]

\textbf{Figure 10.3:} Determining the first moment of area around the
neutral axis of a circular cross-section.

Note that both of these are only for finding the first moment of area at
the neutral axis (Q\textsubscript{max}). If the first moment of area
around any other axis is required, these shortcuts will not work, and
the general process will need to be used.

\section{Shear Stress}\label{sec-10.2}

Click to expand

In section 2.2 we learned about average shear stress

\[
\tau_{\text {avg }}=\frac{V}{A}
\]

This is the average shear stress on a cross-section, but shear stress
actually varies along the section (Figure 10.4). For a vertical internal
shear force, shear stress is zero at the top and bottom of a
cross-section and maximum at the neutral axis. Shear stress varies in a
parabolic fashion. The average shear stress does not provide a full
picture and it is often necessary to calculate the shear stress at a
specific point on the cross-section instead.

\textbf{Figure 10.4:} Parabolic variation in shear stress over a
cross-section. For a vertical shear force on a uniform cross-section,
the shear stress is zero at the top and bottom of the section and
maximum at the neutral axis.

To derive the shear stress formula, we'll begin by examining a small 2D
element on a body subjected to an internal shear force (Figure 10.5). If
this element is in equilibrium, a shear force applied to one face of
this element must also produce shear forces (and therefore shear
stresses) on the other faces of the element.

\textbf{Figure 10.5:} Element A on the beam is subjected to shear force
V on the right side. For the element to be in equilibrium there must
also be an equal and opposite force V on the other side. However, this
element will rotate so there must be two additional forces to create an
equal moment in the opposite direction.

Thus, an element experiencing a vertical shear stress also experiences a
horizontal shear stress. This is known as the \emph{complementary
property of shear}. This effect can be seen by forming a `beam' out of a
stack of paper and applying a vertical force. The pieces of paper slide
horizontally relative to each other (Figure 10.6).

\textbf{Figure 10.6:} A stack of papers representing a beam. The ends of
the beam are initially vertical. Load F is applied, creating an internal
vertical shear force. The papers slide relative to each other
horizontally, indicating that there must also be a horizontal shear
force created.

Another example is a wooden beam that fails due to shear. In such beams,
cracks tend to appear horizontally even though the applied load is
vertical. This is due to horizontal shear stress between the layers of
the wood (Figure 10.7).

\textbf{Figure 10.7:} Horizontal shear failure in a wooden beam
subjected to a vertical load.

Imagine a beam subjected to an arbitrary vertical load. Consider a small
cross-section of width Δx (Figure 10.8). This cross-section is subjected
to an external load, an internal shear force on each side of the
cross-section, and an internal bending moment on each side of the
cross-section. The two shear forces and two bending moments are not
necessarily equal.

\textbf{Figure 10.8:} Internal loads on a small cross-section of width
Δx on a beam subjected to an arbitrary vertical load, w = f(x). The
internal loads on the right side of the section are slightly larger than
those on the left.

By considering horizontal equilibrium, we do not need to account for the
vertical loads (V, V + ΔV, and w). The bending moments (M and M + ΔM)
will create horizontal stresses (Figure 10.9) equal to

\[
\sigma_{x 1}=\frac{M y}{I}
\]

and

\[
\sigma_{x 2}=\frac{(M+\Delta M) y}{I}
\]

Since \(F=\sigma A\), we can determine the total force applied by each
bending moment:

\[
F_1=\int \frac{M y}{I} d A
\]

and

\[
F_2=\int \frac{(M+\Delta M) y}{I} d A
\]

\textbf{Figure 10.9:} Horizontal stresses created by moments M and (M +
ΔM).

Each force is tensile in part of the beam and compressive in part of the
beam. When calculated across the entire cross-section these forces will
sum to zero. However, if we consider only part of the cross-section the
forces do not sum to zero (Figure 10.10). For the beam to be in
equilibrium, there must be a horizontal shear force. For now we'll call
this force F' and derive an equation for the shear stress it creates.

\textbf{Figure 10.10:} Forces F\textsubscript{1} and F\textsubscript{2}
do not balance when considering only part of the element. There must be
an additional internal shear force F'.

By equilibrium:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sum F_x=F^{\prime}+\int \frac{M y}{I} d A-\int \frac{(M+\Delta M) y}{I} d A=0 \\
& F^{\prime}=-\int \frac{M y}{I} d A+\int \frac{M y}{I} d A+\int \frac{\Delta M y}{I} d A \\
& F^{\prime}=\int \frac{\Delta M y}{I} d A=\frac{\Delta M}{I} \int y d A
\end{aligned}
\]

Once the constants are taken out of the integral, the remaining integral
is just the first moment of area, Q.

\[
F^{\prime}=\frac{\Delta M}{I} Q
\]

We can calculate the shear stress from \(\tau=\frac{V}{A}\) where V = F'
and A is the area of the cross-section that force F' acts on. This area
will be width, Δx, multiplied by the thickness of the beam, t.

\[
\tau=\frac{V}{A}=\frac{F^{\prime}}{\Delta x t}=\frac{\Delta M Q}{\Delta x I t}
\]

From section 7.2 we know that the change in moment with respect to x is
equal to the shear force, V

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\Delta M}{\Delta x}=V \\
& \tau=\frac{V Q}{I t}
\end{aligned}
\]

\emph{where}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  τ = Shear stress at a point on the cross-section {[}Pa, psi{]}
\item
  V = Internal shear force at the cross-section {[}N, lb{]}
\item
  Q = 1st moment of area at the point of interest on the cross-section
  {[}m\textsuperscript{3}, in\textsuperscript{3}{]}
\item
  I = Area moment of inertia of the cross-section
  {[}m\textsuperscript{4}, in\textsuperscript{4}{]}
\item
  t = thickness of the cross-section {[}m, in{]}
\end{itemize}

This is the shear stress equation, allowing us to calculate the shear
stress at any point on a cross-section. This is often more useful than
simply calculating the average shear stress across the entire
cross-section.

Example 10.3 demonstrates calculation of the maximum shear stress in a
simply supported beam with a circular cross-section.

Example 10.4 demonstrates how to calculate the maximum stress is a
cross-section of varying thickness.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 10.3}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A simply supported beam with the circular cross-section shown is
subjected to a uniformly distributed load w = 30 kN/m across its entire
length L = 8 m. Determine the maximum shear stress that occurs in the
beam.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The shear stress can be calculated from \(\tau=\frac{V Q}{I t}\). The
maximum shear stress will occur when V and Q are at their maximum
values.

The maximum shear force, V\textsubscript{max}, can be found by drawing a
shear force diagram. Start with a free body diagram of the beam and use
this to sketch the shear force diagram using the graphical method of
section 7.4. The loading and supports are symmetric, so each support
will resist half of the applied load.

\[
A=B=\frac{w L}{2}=\frac{30\frac{kN}{m} * 8{~m}}{2}=120{~kN}
\]

{[}figure{]}

From the diagram it is apparent that the maximum shear force in the
beam, V\textsubscript{max} = 120 kN. This occurs at the supports.

The area moment of inertia for the circular cross-section is given by

\[
I=\frac{\pi}{4} r^4=\frac{\pi}{4}(0.02{~m})^4=1.257 \times 10^{-7}{~m}^4
\]

The maximum first moment of area, Q\textsubscript{max}, occurs at the
neutral axis of the cross-section. For a circular cross-section it was
demonstrated in the text that

\[
Q_{max}=\frac{2}{3}r^3=\frac{2}{3}(0.02{~m})^3=5.33\times10^6{~m}^3
\]

The thickness of the cross-section at the neutral axis is equal to the
diameter, t = 0.04 m.

With all of the terms known, we can now calculate the maximum shear
stress in the beam.

\[
\tau=\frac{V Q}{I t}=\frac{120,000{~N} * 5.33 \times 10^{-6}{~m}^3}{1.257 \times 10^{-7}{~m}^4 * 0.04{~m}}=127\times10^6\frac{N}{m^2}=127{~MPa}
\]

Determine the y-coordinate of the centroid using the method of section

\end{aligned}
\]

Determine the area moment of inertia of the entire cross-section using
the method of Section~\ref{sec-8.2}

\[
I=\left(\frac{1 * 5^3}{12}+5 *(2.5-6.1)^2\right)+\left(\frac{5 * 4^3}{12}+20 *(7-6.1)^2\right)=118.08{~in.}^4
\]

\textbf{The shear force at the neutral axis of the cross-section}

Draw a line through the point of interest and use the area above this

{[}figure{]}

\[
Q=y A=\frac{2.9{~in.}}{2} *(2.9{~in.} * 5{~in.})=21.025{~in.}^3
\]

The thickness of the cross-section at this point, t = 5 in.

The shear stress at the neutral axis is then given by:

\[
\tau=\frac{V Q}{I t}=\frac{20,000{~lb} * 21.025{~in.}^3}{118.08{~in.}^4 * 5{~in.}}=712{~psi}
\]

\textbf{The shear stress at the point where the thickness of the
cross-section changes}

Draw a line through the point of interest and use the area above this
line to calculate the first moment of area.

{[}figure{]}

\[
Q=y A=0.9{~in.} *(4 {~in.}* 5{~in.})=18{~in.}^3
\]

The thickness of the cross-section at this point, t = 1 in.

The shear stress at this line is then given by:

\[
\tau=\frac{V Q}{I t}=\frac{20,000 {~lb}* 18{~in.}^3}{118.08{~in.}^4 * 1{~in.}}=3,049{~psi}
\]

Note that even though the first moment of area is smaller at this axis,
the stress is larger because the thickness of the cross-section
decreases significantly at this point.

\section{Shear Flow}\label{sec-10.3}

Click to expand

Some cross-sections are formed by connecting multiple pieces together
with fasteners such as nails or bolts (Figure 10.11). In such members,
we must analyze not only the stresses in the cross-section itself but
also the stresses in the fasteners.

\textbf{Figure 10.11:} T cross-section formed by connecting two boards
together with nails. There is a consistent spacing s between nails along
the length of the beam.

A useful quantity in this regard is shear flow, q. Shear flow measures
of how much shear force is applied per unit length of the beam, and it
is measured in units of force/length {[}N/m, lb/in.{]}. For example, if
a nail is capable of resisting a shear force up to 10 kN and there is a
shear flow of 30 kN/m, it is trivial to determine that we need at least
3 nails for every meter of beam.

Recall from section 10.2 that the internal horizontal shear force, F',
may be written as

\[
F^{\prime}=\frac{\Delta M}{I} Q
\]

Dividing both sides by Δx

\[
\frac{F^{\prime}}{\Delta x}=\frac{\Delta M Q}{\Delta x I}
\]

Similar to our derivation in the previous section, we may replace
\(\frac{\Delta M}{\Delta x}=V\). We may also replace
\(\frac{F^{\prime}}{\Delta x}=q\).

\[
q=\frac{V Q}{I}
\]

\emph{where}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  q = Shear flow at a line on the cross-section {[}N/m, lb/in{]}
\item
  V = Internal shear force at the cross-section {[}N, lb{]}
\item
  Q = 1st moment of area at the point of interest on the cross-section
  {[}m\textsuperscript{3}, in\textsuperscript{3}{]}
\item
  I = Area moment of inertia of the cross-section
  {[}m\textsuperscript{4}, in\textsuperscript{4}{]}
\end{itemize}

This equation is very similar to the shear stress equation, but the
thickness of the cross-section doesn't appear here as shear flow is
measured per unit length. We will generally want to determine the shear
flow at the seam where the individual pieces of the cross-section are
joined together as this is where the fasteners must resist the
horizontal shear force.

Often we want to determine how far apart we can space the nails along
the length of the beam. Since shear flow is the shear force per unit
length, if we know how much shear force each fastener can resist, we can
say that the shear flow is equal to the force resisted by each fastener
(F\textsubscript{nail}) divided by the spacing between the fasteners
(s). Sometimes there will be multiple rows of nails side-by-side (Figure
10.12). In this case we can multiply the force resisted by each fastener
by the number of rows (r).

\[
q=\frac{V Q}{I}=\frac{F_{\text {nail }} r}{s}
\]

\textbf{Figure 10.12:} T cross-section held together by two rows of
nails. The rows are spaced evenly along the length of the beam by
distance \emph{s}.

Sometimes fasteners may be placed horizontally (Figure 10.13). In these
cases we should still draw a line along the seam perpendicular to the
fastener (so vertically in this case). We can then use the area either
to the left or right of this line to determine the first moment of area.
Note that we still use the vertical distance between the centroid of our
chosen area and the neutral axis of the cross-section.

\textbf{Figure 10.13:} A horizontal fastener requires a vertical line
along the seam and the selection of the area either to the left or right
of this line. When calculating the first moment of area by Q = yA, the
distance y is still in the vertical direction.

Example 10.5 demonstrates\ldots{} {[}text{]}

Example 10.6 demonstrates\ldots{} {[}text{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 10.5}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A beam is made by nailing together three boards to form the
cross-section shown. At each connection, two rows of nails are used to
secure the boards. Each nail can resist a horizontal shearing force of
1,500 N. If the beam is subjected to an internal vertical shear force of
4,500 N, determine the minimum required spacing, s, between the rows of
nails.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

We need to determine the shear flow at one of the points where the beams
are connected. Use \(q=\frac{V Q}{I}\) where V = 4,500 N. Since the
section is symmetric, we can determine the location of the centroid by
inspection, \(\bar{y}=160 \mathrm{~mm}\) from the top and bottom. Now we
need to determine the area moment of inertia, I, for the cross-section.

{[}figure{]}

By considering the area as a large rectangle with two smaller rectangles
cut out:

{[}figure{]}

\[
I=\frac{140 * 320^3}{12}-2\left(\frac{45 * 200^3}{12}\right)=322.3 \times 10^6{~mm}^4=322.3 \times 10^{-6}{~m}^4
\]

Next draw a line through the point of interest (along the seam where the
nails are holding the boards together) and determine the first moment of
area, Q, at this line.

{[}figure{]}

\[
Q=y A=130{~mm} *(60{~mm} * 140{~mm})=1092 \times 10^3{~mm}^3=1,092 \times 10^{-6}{~m}^3
\]

Shear flow:

\[
q=\frac{V Q}{I}=\frac{4500 {~N}* 1092 \times 10^{-6}{~m}^3}{322.3 \times 10^{-6}{~m}^4}=15,247~\frac{N}{m}
\]

Finally, set the shear flow, \(q=\frac{F_{\text {nail }} r}{s}\), and
solve for the spacing, s:

\[
s=\frac{F_{\text {nail }} r}{q}=\frac{1500{~N} * 2}{15247~\frac{N}{m}}=0.197 \mathrm{~m}=197 \mathrm{~mm}
\]

Determine the allowable shear flow in the beam based on the nails.

\[
q=\frac{F_{nail} r}{s}=\frac{700{~lb} * 1}{1.5{~in.}}=467~\frac{lb}{in.}
\]

This shear flow can be set equal to
\(q=\frac{V Q}{I}=467~\frac{lb}{in.}\)

Find the y-coordinate of the centroid of the cross-section, setting the
reference point at the bottom of the section.

{[}figure{]}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& y_1=0.375{~in.}~,~ A_1=5{~in.} * 0.75{~in.}=3.75{~in.}^2 \\
& y_2=4.5{~in.}~,~ A_2=1{~in.} * 9{~in.}=9{~in}^2 \\
& \bar{y}=\frac{(0.375{~in.} * 3.75{~in.}^2)+(4.5{~in.} * 9{~in.}^2)}{3.75{~in.^2}+9{~in.^2}} = 3.287{~in.}~~\text{from the bottom of the section}
\end{aligned}
\]

Find the area moment of inertia for the entire cross-section.

\[
I=\left(\frac{5 * 0.75^3}{12}+3.75 *(3.287-0.375)^2\right)+\left(\frac{1 * 9^3}{12}+9 *(4.5-3.287)^2\right)=106{~in.}^4
\]

Draw a line along the seam where the nails are holding the two boards
together. Note that this is a vertical line. To determine the first
moment of area, Q, we use the area to either the left side or the right
side of this line. Note that when calculating \emph{Q=yA}, the distance
y is still measured in the vertical direction between the centroid of
area A and the neutral axis of the cross-section.

{[}figure{]}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& y=4.5{~in.}-3.287{~in.}=1.213{~in.} \\
& A=(1{~in.} * 9{~in.})=9{~in.}^2 \\
& Q=1.213{~in.} * 9{~in.^2}=10.9{~in.}^3
\end{aligned}
\]

Finally, solve for the maximum allowable internal shear force in the
beam by rearranging the shear flow equation.

\[
V=\frac{q I}{Q}=\frac{467~\frac{lb}{in.} * 106{~in.^4}}{10.9{~in.^3}}=4,541{~lb}
\]

Objects subjected to vertical shear stresses also experience horizontal
shear stresses.

The first moment of area (Q) is an important quantity when considering
shear. It can be calculated along any axis. Generally, the internal
shear force is vertical, and so the first moment of area is calculated
around a horizontal axis. The maximum first moment of area will occur
around the neutral axis of the cross-section.

Shear stress varies in a parabolic manner across the cross-section. For
a vertical shear force it is zero at the top and bottom of the section.
For a uniform cross-section, the maximum shear stress occurs at the
neutral axis as this is where the largest first moment of area is. If
the cross-section varies in thickness, the maximum shear stress may not
be at the neutral axis since the shear stress increases as the thickness
of the cross-section decreases.

Shear flow is a measure of the shear force over a unit length. It is
useful when creating a cross-section by fastening two or more individual
pieces together. The shear flow can be used to determine the maximum
allowable spacing between the fasteners in order to ensure the fasteners
do not break. In practice, this should be done alongside a calculation
of the maximum shear stress in the cross-section.

We now know how to calculate both the bending stress
(Chapter~\ref{sec-bending-loads}) and shear stress
(Chapter~\ref{sec-shear-loads}) in a beam. In this chapter we'll
consider the deformation of a beam subjected to bending and shear
stresses. Under load, beams deflect from their original position (Figure
11.1). Some amount of deflection is unavoidable, but it is usually
desirable to limit deflection as much as possible. Although deflection
often doesn't pose a safety risk (unless the allowable stress of the
beam is also exceeded) too much deflection can render a beam unfit for
purpose.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{images/CH11 PNGs/11.1.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-11.1}A model bridge showing severe deflection along
its span (left). Although the bridge hasn't broken, there is too much
deflection for the application. The deflection in a hockey stick during
a shot (right). In this application the deflection is helpful as it
stores and releases energy during the shot.}

\end{figure}%

Idealized sketches showing the shape of the deflected beam are a helpful
visual aid. This deflected shape is known as the elastic curve (Figure
11.2). Sketches of the elastic curve provide a quick visual reference of
how the beam will deflect and can be used to check that our numerical
answers are realistic.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{images/CH11 PNGs/11.2.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-11.2}Two example beams showing the undeflected
position of the centerline (dotted line) and the deflected position of
the elastic curve (solid line).}

\end{figure}%

In section 5.3 we learned to calculate deformation due to axial load
\(\left(\Delta L=\frac{F L}{A E}\right)\). In section 6.2 we learned to
calculate deformation due to torsional load
\(\left(\varnothing=\frac{T L}{J G}\right)\). Note that both types of
deformation depend on:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Applied/internal load (F, T)
\item
  Length of the object (L)
\item
  Cross-section geometry (A, J)
\item
  Material properties (E, G)
\end{itemize}

It is probably not surprising then that beam deflection also depends on
these four things. We'll study two common techniques for calculating
deflection: The method of integration (sections 11.1 and 11.2) and the
method of superposition (section 11.3). Being able to calculate
deflection is vitally important, as it allows us to predict how much a
beam will deflect before we build a structure. Once we're able to
calculate deflection, we'll use this to help solve some more statically
indeterminate problems (Section 11.4). Finally, we'll build on our beam
design work of section 9.2 by expanding our specifications to include
limitations on not just bending stress, but shear stress and deflection
as well.

\section{Integration of the Moment Equation}\label{sec-11.1}

Click to expand

We'll begin by deriving an equation for calculating the deflection at
any point in a loaded beam. In Chapter 9, we derived two equations
relating to bending stress.

\[
\sigma=-\frac{E y}{\rho}
\]

\[
\sigma=-\frac{M y}{I}
\]

Set these equations equal:

\[
\frac{E y}{\rho}=\frac{M y}{I}
\]

Rearrange:

\[
\frac{1}{\rho}=\frac{M(x)}{E I}
\]

The radius of curvature (ρ) can be related to the deflection (y) by the
equation

\[
\frac{1}{\rho}=\frac{\frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial x^{2}}}{\left[1+\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)^{2}\right]^{\frac{3}{2}}}
\]

This equation describes the exact deflection \((y)\) at any distance
\((x)\) along the beam. In most engineering applications the deflection
\((y)\) is very small. We can simplify this equation significantly by
assuming that our deflection \((y)\) will be small and thus that
\(\frac{d y}{d x}\) is very small and
\(\left(\frac{d y}{d x}\right)^{2}\) is negligible. This simplifies the
equation to

\[
\frac{1}{\rho}=\frac{\frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial x^{2}}}{[1+0]^{\frac{3}{2}}}=\frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial x^{2}}
\]

Finally

\[
\frac{1}{\rho}=\frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial x^{2}}=\frac{M(x)}{E I}
\]

To solve for deflection we can first find an equation for the internal
bending moment as a function of \((x)\), using equilibrium just as we
did in section 7.2 for drawing the bending moment diagram. We can then
set this equation equal to \(E I \frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}\) and integrate
twice.

\[
\begin{gathered}
M(x)=E I \frac{\partial^{2} y}{\partial x^{2}} \\
\int M(x) d x+C 1=E I \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \\
\iint M(x) d x+C 1 x+C 2=E I y
\end{gathered}
\]

In these equations, \(y\) represents the deflection of the beam and
\(\frac{d y}{d x}\) represents the slope of the deflected beam. Since
the equations are functions of \(x\), we can find the slope and
deflection at any point along the beam.

Note that each successive integral introduces a constant of integration
which we must solve for. We do this through the use of boundary
conditions---that is, points on the beam where we already know the slope
and/or deflection. The most common boundary conditions for our
applications will be:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  At any support the deflection \((y)\) is zero
\item
  At a fixed support the slope
  \(\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)\) is zero
\end{itemize}

Figure 11.3 illustrates these boundary conditions. Once the constants of
integration are known, we can define equations for the slope and
deflection of the beam in terms of distance \((x)\) along the beam and
calculate the slope and deflection at any value of \(x\). See
\hyperref[example-11.1]{Example 11.1} and
\hyperref[example-11.2]{Example 11.2} to see this process applied to a
simply supported beam and a cantilever beam respectively.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{images/CH11 PNGs/11.3.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-11.3}At pin and roller supports, the deflection is
zero but the slope is not. At a fixed support, both the slope and
deflection are zero. For a statically determinate beam in equilibrium we
will always have two boundary conditions.}

Sketch a free body diagram of the beam and use equilibrium equations to
solve for the reaction forces at the supports:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.65625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.1-2.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sum M_A=-wL\left(\frac{L}{2}\right)+B L=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad B=\frac{wL}{2} \\
& \sum F y= A-wL+\frac{wL}{2}=0 \quad\rightarrow\quad A=\frac{wL}{2} \\
& \end{aligned}
\]

Cut a cross-section through the beam at distance x and draw a free body
diagram of everything to the left of the cut, including the internal
loads. Use equilibrium to determine an equation for the internal bending
moment, M, as a function of x:

\begin{center}

\[
\begin{gathered} \sum M_A= M+w x\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)-\frac{w L}{2}(x)=0 \\ M =\frac{w L x}{2}-\frac{w x^2}{2}=E I \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}\end{gathered}
\]

Integrate this equation twice:

\[
\begin{aligned} & \frac{w L x^2}{4}-\frac{w x^3}{6}+c_1=E I \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \\ & \frac{w L x^3}{12}-\frac{w x^4}{24}+c_1 x+c_2=E I y\end{aligned}
\]

Apply boundary conditions at the supports:

\[
\begin{aligned} & \text { At } x=0, y=0 \rightarrow C_2=0 \\ & \text { At } x=L, y=0 \rightarrow \frac{w L(L)^3}{12}-\frac{w(L)^4}{24}+C_1 L=0 \\ & C_1=\frac{w L^3}{24}-\frac{wL^3}{12}=-\frac{w L^3}{24}\end{aligned}
\]

Substitute these constants into the deflection equation and rearrange:

\[
y=\frac{1}{E I}\left[\frac{w L x^3}{12}-\frac{w x^4}{24}-\frac{wL^3}{24} x\right]
\]

Substitute in the given values for and solve this equation at the
midpoint (x=5m):

\[

Cut a cross-section through the beam at distance x and draw a free body
diagram of everything to the left of the cut, including the internal
loads. This diagram won't include any of the reactions at the fixed
support so there's no need to solve for these first. Use equilibrium to
determine an equation for the internal bending moment, M, as a function
of x. Then integrate this equation twice:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.2-2.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{gathered} \sum M_x=M+\frac{w_0 x^2}{2 L}\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)=0 \\ M=-\frac{w_0 x^3}{6 L}=E I \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \\ -\frac{w_0 x^4}{24 L}+C_1=E I \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \\ -\frac{w_0 x^5}{120 L}+C_1 x+C_2=EIy\end{gathered}
\]

Apply boundary conditions at the fixed support:

\[
\begin{gathered} \text { At } x=L, \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{w_0 L^4}{24 L}+C_1=0
\\ c_1=\frac{w_0 L^3}{24}
\\ \text { At } x=L, y=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{w_0 L^5}{120 L}+\frac{w_0 L^3}{24}(L)+C_2=0
\\ C_2=\frac{w_0 L^4}{120}-\frac{w_0 L^4}{24}=-\frac{4 w_0 L^4}{120}=-\frac{w_0 L^4}{30} \end{gathered}
\]

Substitute these constants into the deflection equation and rearrange:

\[
y=\frac{1}{E I}\left[-\frac{w_0 x^5}{120L}+\frac{w_0 L^3}{24} x-\frac{w_0 L^4}{30}\right]
\]

Substitute in the given values and solve this equation at the free end
(x = 0). Remember to convert feet to inches in both the distributed load
and the length:

\[
\begin{aligned} & y=\frac{1}{29 \times 10^6~\frac{lb}{in.}*375{~in.^4}} \left[-\frac{\frac{30000{~lb}}{12~\frac{in.}{ft}}*(8{~ft}*12~\frac{in.}{ft})^4}{30}\right] \\ & y=- 0.651{~in.}\end{aligned}
\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

The above examples have single continuous loads. If the loading is
discontinuous we must modify our approach as there will not be one
single moment equation that describes the entire beam. We saw in section
7.2 when drawing shear force \& bending moment diagrams that we can find
a different equation for the internal bending moment in each loading
region (i.e., a piecewise function over the length of the beam). We must
find separate moment equations for each loading region and integrate
each separately. This must be done each time the loading changes (a
discontinuity in the moment diagram), such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Both sides of a concentrated load
\item
  Whenever a distributed load begins or ends
\end{itemize}

See \hyperref[example-11.3]{Example 11.3} for an example of a beam with
2 loading regions. Note that in this example we will need to determine 2
internal bending moment equations and integrate each equation twice,
thereby introducing four constants of integration. Two of these can
still be determined by using boundary conditions, but we still need to
determine the other two. This is done with continuity conditions.

Equation set 1 describes the internal moment, slope, and deflection of
the beam from point A to point B, and equation set 2 describes the
internal moment, slope, and deflection from point B to point C. Note
that both sets of equations describe point B, where the loading changes.
They must therefore return the same results at point B. We can therefore
say that

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{1} & =\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{2} \\
y_{1} & =y_{2}
\end{aligned}
\]

\]

Cut a cross-section in the first loading region at distance

&M_1=80 x_1-10 x_1^2=E I \frac{\partial^2 y_1}{\partial x_1^2} \\

&\frac{80 x_1^3}{6}-\frac{10 x_1^4}{12}+C_1 x_1+c_2=E I y_1

\]

These equations are valid from 6m ≤ x\textsubscript{2} ≤ 9m:

Apply bounding conditions at the supports. One support is in loading
region 1 while the other is in region 2. Be careful to use the
appropriate deflection equation when applying the boundary conditions:

\[
\begin{aligned} & \text { At } x_1=0, y_1=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad c_2=0 \\ & \text { At } x_2=9, y_2=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{360(9)^2}{2}-\frac{40(4)^3}{6}+c_3(9) +C_4=0 \\ & c_4=-9 c_3-9720\end{aligned}
\]

Apply continuity conditions at the point where the loading changes
(x\textsubscript{1} = x\textsubscript{2} = 6 m):

\[
\begin{gathered} \text { At } x_1=x_2=6 \mathrm{~m}, \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_1}=\frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_2} \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{80(6)^2}{2}-\frac{10(6)^3}{3}+c_1=360(6)-\frac{40(6)^2}{2}+c_3 \\ 1440-720+c_1=2160-720+c_3 \\ C_1=720+C_3 \\ \\  \text { At } x_1=x_2=6 \mathrm{~m}, y_1=y_2 \quad \rightarrow \quad\frac{80(6)^3}{6}-\frac{10(6)^4}{12}+c_1(6)=\frac{360(6)^2}{2} - \frac{40(6)^3}{6}+c_3(6) +C_4 \\ 2880-1080+6 C_1=6480-1440+6 C_3+C_4 \\ 1800+6 C_1=5040+6 C_3+C_4 \\\end{gathered}
\]

Substitute in C\textsubscript{4} = -9C\textsubscript{3} - 9720 and
C\textsubscript{1} = 720 + C\textsubscript{3}

\[
\begin{gathered}
1800+6\left(720+c_3\right)=5040+6 c_3+c_4 \\
1800+4320+6 c_3=5040+6 c_3+c_4 \\
6120-5040=c_4 \\

c_3=-1200 \\\\
c_1=720+c_3=720-1200 \\
c_1=-480
\end{gathered}
\]

Substitute constants into deflection equations:

\[
\begin{aligned}y_1 & =\frac{1}{E I}\left[\frac{80 x_1^3}{6}-\frac{10 x_1^4}{12}-480 x_1\right] \\y_2 & =\frac{1}{E I}\left[\frac{360 x_2^2}{2}-\frac{40 x_2^3}{6}+1200 x_3+1080\right]\end{aligned}
\]

Deflection at midpoint occurs when x\textsubscript{1} = 5m:

\[
\begin{aligned}
y_1&=\frac{1}{EI} {\left[\frac{80{~kN}*(5{~m})^3}{6}-\frac{10~\frac{kN}{m}*(5{~m})^4}{12}-480{~kN}\cdot{m^2}*(5{~m})\right] \\

It is not required that we make both cuts from the left. In some cases
it may be easier to make one cut from the left and the other from the
right. Consider the simple beam in Figure 11.4. When making a cut in the
region not under the distributed load, a free body diagram to the left
of the cut has many more forces than a free body diagram of the right
side.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics[width=4.66667in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/11.4.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-11.4}Simple beam showing two options for finding the
internal bending moment. Note that the moment equation will be much
simpler if we draw the right hand side of the cut.}

\end{figure}%

The moment equation will be much simpler if we draw the right hand side
of the cut. This in turn simplifies the integrations and the math
involved in finding the constants of integration. We must however make
one change to our continuity conditions if we measure distance
x\textsubscript{2} from the right. When making both cuts from the left
we said that at point C the slope and deflection from calculated from
equation 1 must be the same as those calculated from equation 2.

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{d y}{d x}\right)_{1} & =\left(\frac{d y}{d x}\right)_{2} \\
y_{1} & =y_{2}
\end{aligned}
\]

When measuring distance x\textsubscript{2} from the right, it is still
true at point C that {[}math{]} as the deflection is still downwards
regardless of whether we measure our horizontal distance from the left
or right. The magnitude of the slope will also be the same at point C
regardless of which equation we use to calculate it. However, the
direction of rotation of the slope will change from counter-clockwise to
clockwise due to us changing the coordinate system (Figure 11.5). Thus
our second boundary condition must become

\[
\left(\frac{d y}{d x}\right)_{1}=-\left(\frac{d y}{d x}\right)_{2}
\]

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{images/CH11 PNGs/11.5.png}

\caption{\label{fig-11.5}Depending on which side of the cut we draw, the
deflection at point C will have the same magnitude and direction. The
slope at point C will have the same magnitude but opposite directions if
we make one cut from the left and the other from the right.}

\end{figure}%

This negative sign is vitally important, and we will not get the correct
answer if we forget to include it. \hyperref[example-11.3b]{Example
11.3} has been reworked below, this time with one cut made from the
right hand side instead. Compare to the previous solution to see the
differences.

A simply supported beam is subjected to a distributed load of w = 20
kN/m as shown. Determine the equation of the elastic curve between 0 ≤ x
≤ 6 m and between 6 m ≤ x ≤ 9m.~

Then determine the deflection at x = 5m. Assume E = 200 GPa and I = 394
x 10\textsuperscript{6} mm4.

Proceed through first cut as before and find:

\[
\begin{aligned} & \frac{80 x_1^2}{2}-\frac{10 x_1^3}{3}+c_1=EI\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_1} \\ & \frac{80 x_1^3}{6}-\frac{10 x_1^4}{12}+c_1 x_1+c_2=-EI y_1\end{aligned}
\]

Make second cut from right-hand-side. Draw a free body diagram and use
equilibrium to determine an equation for the internal bending moment,
M\textsubscript{2}, as a function of x\textsubscript{2}. Then integrate
this equation twice.

\begin{center}

\frac{40 x_2^2}{2}+c_3=EI \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_2} \\
\frac{40 x_2^3}{6}+c_3 x_2+c_4=E I y_2 \\
\end{gathered}
\]Apply boundary conditions as before, although this time the roller
support is at x\textsubscript{2} = 0 since we're measuring
x\textsubscript{2} from the right side:

\[
\begin{aligned} & \text { At } x_1=0, y_1=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad c_2=0 \text { (as before) }\\ & \text { At } x_2=0, y_2=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad c_4=0\end{aligned}
\]

Apply continuity conditions at the point where the loading changes
(x\textsubscript{1} = 6 m, x\textsubscript{2} = 3 m):

\[
\begin{gathered} \text { At } x_1=6 \mathrm{~m}, x_2=3 \mathrm{~m}, y_1=y_2 \rightarrow \frac{80(6)^3}{6}-\frac{10(6)^4}{12}+ c_1(6)=\frac{40(3)^3}{6}+c_3(3) \\ 2880-1080+6 c_1=180+3 c_3 \\ 540+2 c_1=c_3 \\ \\ \text { At } x_1=6 \mathrm{~m},  x_2=3 \mathrm{m}, \frac{d y_1}{d x_1}=-\frac{d y_2}{d x_2} \rightarrow \frac{80(6)^2}{2}-\frac{10(6)^3}{3}+c_1=-\frac{40(3)^2}{2}-c_3 \\ 1440-720+c_1=-180-c_3 \\ 900+c_1=-c_3 \\\end{gathered}
\]

Substitute in 540 + 2c\textsubscript{1} = c\textsubscript{3}:

\[
\begin{aligned} 540+2 c_1 & =-900-c_1 \\ 3 c_1 & =-1440 \\ c_1 & =-480 \text { (as before) }\end{aligned}
\]

\[
900-480 =-c_3 \\ c_3 =-420
\]

Substitute constants into deflection equations:

\[
\begin{aligned} & y_1=\frac{1}{EI}\left[\frac{80 x_1^3}{6}-\frac{10 x_1^4}{12}-480 x_1\right] \quad \text { (as before) } \\ & y_2=\frac{1}{E I}\left[\frac{40 x_2^3}{6}-420 x_2\right]\end{aligned}

Deflection at midpoint occurs when x\textsubscript{1} = 5m:

\section{Integration of the Load Equation}\label{sec-11.2}

Click to expand

In section 11.1 we used equilibrium equations to determine the internal
bending moment in a beam as a function of x. We related this bending
moment to the deflection by

\[
M(x)=E I \frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}
\]

In section 7.3 we learned that there is a relationship between the
internal bending moment, the internal shear force, and the external
load. For an external distributed load, w, we found

\[
V=\int_{0}^{L} w(x) d x
\]

\[
M=\int_{0}^{L} V(x) d x
\]

We may therefore relate the deflection of a beam to not only the
internal bending moment, but also the internal shear force and external
distributed load through successive integrations. For some loading
configurations it can be much simpler to integrate the distributed load
equation 4 times instead of finding the equation of the internal bending
moment through equilibrium and integrating twice. When doing this,
remember that loads acting downwards (as most loads on beams do) are
negative.

\[
\begin{gathered}
w(x)=E I \frac{d^{4} y}{d x^{4}} \\
V(x)=E I \frac{d^{3} y}{d x^{3}}=\int w(x) d x+C 1 \\
M(x)=E I \frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}=\int V(x) d x+C 2 \\
\theta(x)=E I \frac{d y}{d x}=\int M(x) d x+C 3 \\
y(x)=\int \theta(x) d x+C 4
\end{gathered}
\]

Note that each successive integral will introduce a new constant of
integration. We must again apply boundary conditions in order to solve
for these constants. There are now four constants so we require four
boundary conditions. Two of these are the same as in section 11.1:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  At any support the deflection is 0
\item
  At a fixed support, both the slope and deflection are zero
\end{itemize}

The other two boundary conditions come from knowing the value of the
shear force and bending moment at a point in the beam. We are able to
find these from our work in chapter 7. While we can use known values at
any point in the beam, it is generally easiest to use the shear force
and bending moment at x = 0. At this point:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The shear force will be equal to the applied force (including a force
  applied by a support) if there is one, or zero otherwise.
\item
  The bending moment will be equal to the applied moment (including a
  moment applied by a fixed support) if there is one, or zero otherwise.
\end{itemize}

See \hyperref[example-11.4]{Example 11.4} for a demonstration of how to
find the deflection of a beam by integrating the load equation. Note
that while this method can be used for any beam, it is best applied to
beams with a single continuous distributed load acting over the length
of the beam. Beams with discontinuous loading will require integration
of multiple load equations.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 11.4}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A cantilever beam from \hyperref[example-11.2]{Example 11.2} is repeated
here. Length L = 8 ft is subjected to a linear distributed load where
w\textsubscript{0} = 30 kip/ft. Determine the equation of the elastic
curve and use this to find the deflection of the beam at the free end.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.92708in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.4-1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

First define the equation of the load, which increases linearly from
zero to w\textsubscript{0}:

\[
\omega=-\omega_0 \frac{x}{L}=E I \frac{\partial^4 y}{\partial x^4}
\]

Integrate this equation 4 times:

\[
\begin{aligned} & -\frac{w_0 x^2}{2 L}+c_1=E I \frac{\partial^3 y}{\partial x^3} \\ & -\frac{w_0 x^3}{6 L}+c_1 x+c_2=EI\frac{\partial^3 y}{\partial x^2} \\ & -\frac{w_0 x^4}{24 L}+\frac{c_1 x^2}{2}+c_2 x+c_3=E I \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \\ & -\frac{w_0 x^5}{120L}+\frac{c_1 x^3}{6}+\frac{c_2 x^2}{2}+c_3 x+c_4=EIy \\ & \end{aligned}
\]

Apply boundary conditions at the fixed support. At the free end the
internal shear force and bending moment will be zero. At the fixed
support (at x = L) the slope and deflection will be zero.

\[
\begin{aligned} &\text { At } x=0, v=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad c_1=0 \\ &\text { At } x=0, M=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad c_2=0 \\ &\text { At } x=L, \frac{d y}{d x}=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad c_3=\frac{w_0 L^3}{24} \\ &\text { At } x=L, y=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad c_4=-\frac{w_0L^4}{30} \end{aligned}
\]

This is the same result found in Example 11.2 and the problem proceeds
in the same way to find the deflection at the free end.

Substitute these constants into the deflection equation and rearrange:

\[
y=\frac{1}{E I}\left[-\frac{w_0 x^5}{120L}+\frac{w_0 L^3}{24} x-\frac{w_0 L^4}{30}\right]
\]

Substitute in the given values and solve this equation at the free end
(x = 0). Remember to convert feet to inches in both the distributed load
and the length:

\[
\begin{aligned} & y=\frac{1}{29 \times 10^6 \times 375} \left[-\frac{\frac{30000}{12} \times (8\times12)^4}{30}\right] \\ & y=- 0.651 \mathrm{~in.}\end{aligned}
\]

\section{Superposition}\label{sec-11.3}

Click to expand

It should be apparent from the previous sections that finding deflection
using the method of integration can become quite complicated and
time-consuming if there are multiple loads. In such cases, the method of
superposition is a good alternative.

Beams are typically loaded in a relatively small number of standard
configurations, and the deflection behavior of a beam subjected to one
of these standard loads is very well understood. A subset of beam
deflections have been included in Appendix C. @figure11.6 shows an
example of the information provided for one such beam.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH11 PNGs/11.6.png}

}

\caption{Appendix C contains some standard loading configurations along
with a sketch of the elastic curve, equations for the maximum deflection
and maximum slope, and the general equation of the elastic curve.}

\end{figure}%

This can be useful even for more complex loading. When multiple loads
act on a beam, the effect of each load on the deflection of the beam may
be considered independently. Thus, even for loading more complex than
the loads in Appendix C, it may be possible to simplify the problem by
considering each load separately and calculating the deflection caused
at a point by each load (@figure11.7). These deflections can then be
added together to find the overall deflection at that point. We must of
course calculate the deflection at the same point for each load in order
to add them together. See \hyperref[example-11.5]{Example 11.5} for a
demonstration.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH11 PNGs/11.7.png}

}

\caption{Although Appendix C doesn't contain a cantilever beam with both
a distributed load and a concentrated load, it does contain cantilever
beams with each load separately. We may find the combined deflection by
finding the deflection of each load separately and adding them
together.}

\[
\begin{aligned} y_w = - \frac{wL^4}{8EI} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad &\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad y_F=-\frac{FL^3}{3EI} \\ y_{max}=-&\frac{wL^4}{8EI} - \frac{FL^3}{3EI} \end{aligned}
\]

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 11.5}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A simply supported beam is subjected to a distributed load w = 10 kN/m
and a concentrated load F = 50 kN. If distance a = 6 m and b = 2 m,
determine the deflection at the midpoint of the beam (x = 4 m).

Assume E = 210 GPa and I = 275 x 10\textsuperscript{6}
mm\textsuperscript{4}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.79167in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.5-1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Consider each load separately. We'll start with the distributed load
(although this can be done in any order).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.8125in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.5-2.png}
\end{center}

From Appendix C we can see that the maximum deflection for this load
occurs at the center of the beam, which is the point we're interested
in.

\[
\begin{aligned} y=-\frac{5 w L^4}{384 E I}=-\frac{5 \times 20000 \times 8^4}{384 \times 210 \times 10^9 \times 275 \times 10^{-6}} & =-0.01847 \mathrm{~m} \\ & =-18.47 \mathrm{~mm}\end{aligned}
\]

Now consider the concentrated load

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.75in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.5 copy 2.png}

Here the maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the beam. We
can use the elastic curve equation for x \textless{} a to find the
deflection at x = 4 m when the load is applied at a = 6 m.

\[
\begin{aligned} y=\frac{F b}{6 E I L}\left[x^3-\left(L^2-b^2\right) x\right] & =\frac{50000 \times 2}{6 \times 210 \times 10^9 \times 275 \times 10^{-6} \times 8}\left[4^3-\left(8^2-2^2\right) 4\right] \\ & =-0.00635 \mathrm{~m} \\ & =-6.35 \mathrm{~mm}\end{aligned}

The total deflection at the midpoint of the beam is

\section{Statically Indeterminate Deflection}\label{sec-11.4}

Click to expand

A problem is statically indeterminate if there are more unknown support
reactions than there are equilibrium equations to solve for them. We
have seen statically indeterminate problems in section 5.5 and section
6.4. In both sections we used a similar method to solve statically
indeterminate problems where we took advantage of our knowledge of
deformation in order to solve for one of the reaction forces before
using equilibrium equations to find the others. We'll do something
similar here. We may use either an integration method similar to that of
section 11.1 or a superposition method similar to that of section 11.3.

In practice, engineers design structures with redundancies so that if
one part fails it can be replaced without the entire structure
collapsing. As such, static indeterminacy is the norm.

In section 11.1 we cut a cross-section and found the internal bending
moment as a function of x, M = f(x). We integrated this twice to
determine the equation of the elastic curve. For statically
indeterminate problems, we will write our moment equation as a function
of both x and A, where A is the unknown force at the redundant support.
After integrating this equation twice we will have three unknowns, but
also three boundary conditions. We will therefore be able to solve for
the redundant reaction force and then use equilibrium equations to solve
for the other reactions. See \hyperref[example-11.6]{Example 11.6}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 11.6}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A propped cantilever beam of length L = 6 ft is subjected to a linear
distributed load where w\textsubscript{0} = 20 kips/ft. Determine the
reactions at supports A and B.

\begin{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A free body diagram of the beam shows that we have 4 unknowns and only 3
equilibrium equations. We can solve \(\sum F_x=0\) to find \(B_x = 0\),
but that still leaves us with 3 unknowns and 2 equations.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.82292in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.6-2.png}
\end{center}

Cut a cross-section and determine the internal bending moment in terms
of distance x and redundant force A\textsubscript{y}. Set this equation
equal to \(EI\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}\) and integrate twice:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.6-3.png}
\end{center}

\[
\begin{gathered} \sum M_x=0: \quad M+\frac{w_0 x^2}{2 L}\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)-A_y x=0 \\ M=A_y x-\frac{w_0 x^3}{6 L}=EI \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \\ \frac{A_y x^2}{2}-\frac{w_0 x^4}{24 L}+c_1=E I \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \\ \frac{A_y x^3}{6}-\frac{w_0 x^5}{120 L}+c_1 x+c_2=E I y\end{gathered}
\]

We have 3 unknowns (A\textsubscript{y}, c\textsubscript{1},
c\textsubscript{2}) and 3 boundary conditions (at the roller, deflection
equals zero. At the fixed support, both slope and deflection equal
zero). Apply the boundary conditions:

\[
\begin{aligned} & \text { At } x=0, y=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad c_2=0 \\ & \text { At } x=L, y=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{A_y L^3}{6}-\frac{w_0 L^4}{120}+c_1 L=0 \\ & \text { At } x=L, \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad \frac{A y L^2}{2}-\frac{w_0 L^3}{24}+c_1=0\end{aligned}
\]

Rearrange and substitute:

\[
\begin{gathered}c_1=\frac{w_{0 L}{ }^3}{24}-\frac{A_y L^2}{2} \\ \frac{A_y L^3}{6}-\frac{w_0 L^4}{120}+\frac{w_0 L^4}{24}-\frac{A_y L^3}{2}=0 \\ \frac{-2 A_y L^3}{6}+\frac{4 w_{0} L^4}{120}=0 \\ A_y=\frac{w_0 L}{10}\end{gathered}
\]

We can now reach a numerical answer and find the other reactions by
equilibrium.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.4375in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.6-4.png}

\]

\end{tcolorbox}

This method works well for beams with a single continuous load. While it
can be used for more complex loads, it quickly becomes complicated and
time consuming. For these problems it is generally better to use
superposition.

The method is very similar to the methods used to solve other statically
indeterminate problems in section 5.5 and section 6.4. To solve a
statically indeterminate deflection problem using superposition, first
identify the redundant support. We have 3 equilibrium equations and so
can solve for three unknown support reactions. Any support reactions
beyond this are redundant. Remove the redundant reaction and determine
the deflection due to the applied loads at the point that the reaction
was removed. It is best to remove a support such that the remaining beam
is either simply supported or cantilever as these are the only support
configuration in Appendix C.

Then replace the redundant reaction and determine the deflection due to
this reaction and the point that the reaction is applied. Since there is
actually a support here, the total deflection must be zero. Sum both
deflections and set them equal to zero. This will allow you to calculate
the value of the redundant support. Once this is known the other
reaction loads can be determined using equilibrium. See
\hyperref[example-11.7]{Example 11.7} for a demonstration.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 11.7}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The propped cantilever beam of \hyperref[example-11.6]{Example 11.6} is
shown again here. If length L = 6 ft is subjected to a linear
distributed load where w\textsubscript{0} = 20 kips/ft. Determine the
reactions at supports A and B.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.65625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.7-1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

As demonstrated in Example 11.6, this problem is statically
indeterminate.

This time, let's remove redundant support A\textsubscript{y} and use
Appendix C to find the deflection at point A.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.6875in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.7-2.png}
\end{center}

\[
y_{A_1}=-\frac{w_0 L^4}{30 E I}
\]

Now replace A\textsubscript{y} and use Appendix C to find the deflection
at point A caused by A\textsubscript{y}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.64583in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.7-3.png}
\end{center}

\[
y_{A_2}=\frac{A_{y L}{ }^3}{3 E I}
\]

Since there is actually a support at A, the deflection at A must be
zero.

\[
-\frac{w_0 L^4}{30 E I}+\frac{A_y L^3}{3EI}=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad A_y=\frac{W_0 L}{10}
\]

This is the same answer we found in Example 11.6, and the rest of the
problem proceeds in the same way.

It is possible to remove a moment reaction in order to leave a simply
supported beam. In this case, determining the deflection at the point
that the load was removed isn't helpful as removing the moment reaction
from a fixed support effectively leaves a pin support and the deflection
with the moment removed will still be zero. In this situation we can
instead look at the slope at the point that the reaction was removed.
\hyperref[example-11.7b]{Example 11.7} is repeated below with the moment
at B removed instead of the force at A.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 11.7 (reworked)}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The propped cantilever beam of Example 11.6 is shown again here. If
length L = 6 ft is subjected to a linear distributed load where
w\textsubscript{0} = 20 kips/ft. Determine the reactions at supports A
and B.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.65625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.7v2-1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

This time we'll remove the moment reaction at B to leave a simply
supported beam.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.7v2-2.png}
\end{center}

Finding the deflection at B would not help as it would simply be zero.
Instead, use Appendix C to find the slope at B.

\[
\theta_B=\frac{W_0 L^3}{45 E I}
\]

Now replace the moment reaction at B and use Appendix C to find the
slope at B due to this moment.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.72917in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.7v2-3.png}
\end{center}

\[
\theta_B=-\frac{M_B L}{3 E I}
\]

Since there is actually a fixed support at B, the slope here must be
zero.

\[
\begin{aligned} &\frac{W_0 L^3}{45 E I}-\frac{M_{B L}}{3 E I}=0 \\ &M_B  =\frac{W_0 L^2}{15}\end{aligned}
\]

Adding numbers we get:

\[
M_B=\frac{20 \times 6^2}{15}=48 \text{ kip·ft}
\]

Which is the same answer we found in \hyperref[example-11.6]{Example
11.6}. Reactions A\textsubscript{y} and B\textsubscript{y} can be found
by equilibrium and will also give the same answers as Example 11.6.

\end{tcolorbox}

Note that some problems may involve multiple redundant reactions. In
such cases, remove all redundant reactions and determine the deflection
due to the external loads at every point that a reaction was removed.
Then replace the redundant reactions one at a time and determine the
deflection due to each load at every point that a reaction was removed.
As before, the total deflection at each of these points must be zero.
Sum the deflection at each point and set it equal to zero. There will be
one equation for every redundant reaction and so all redundant reactions
can be calculated.

\section{Intermediate Beam design}\label{sec-11.5}

Click to expand

In Section 9.2 we learned how to use the section modulus to design a
beam to meet bending stress specifications. In practice, beams must also
meet specifications for shear stress and deflection. Limitations will be
placed on all three of these criteria and we must design our beams to
meet all three simultaneously. We'll begin with rectangular
cross-sections and then move on to W beams.

As in section 9.2, problems involving rectangular cross-sections will
typically relate the base and height of the cross-section such that we
only need to determine one dimension. Previously we designed the
cross-section to resist bending stress using:

\[
S_{\min }=\frac{M_{\max }}{\sigma_{\text {allow }}}=\frac{I}{c}
\]

Since \(I=\frac{b h^{3}}{12}\) and \(c=\frac{h}{2}\) we were able to
determine the required dimensions to meet the minimum required section
modulus. The equation \(S=\frac{I}{c}\) will simplify to
\(S=\frac{\frac{b h^{3}}{12}}{\frac{h}{2}}=\frac{2 b h^{3}}{12 h}=\frac{b h^{2}}{6}\)
for a rectangle.

To meet the minimum required shear stress we will use
\(\tau=\frac{V Q}{I t}\). Using the method of section 10.1, it can be
shown for a rectangle (\textbf{?@fig-11.8}) that
\(Q=y A=\frac{h}{4} \frac{b h}{2}=\frac{b h^{2}}{8}\). Since
\(I=\frac{b h^{3}}{12}\) and \(\mathrm{t}=\mathrm{b}\), we can re-write
the shear stress equation to find the maximum shear stress in a
rectangular cross-section as
\(\tau_{\max }=\frac{V \frac{b h^{2}}{8}}{\frac{b h^{3}}{12} b}=\frac{12 V b h^{2}}{8 b^{2} h^{3}}=\frac{12 V}{8 b h}=\frac{3}{2} \frac{V}{A}\).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=3.60417in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/11.8.png}

}

\caption{Rectangular cross-section showing the dimensions used for
calculating the section modulus (S) and first moment of area (Q).}

\end{figure}%

Thus we may set \(\tau_{\max }=\frac{3}{2} \frac{V}{A}\) and solve for
the required dimensions to not exceed the maximum allowable shear
stress.

The maximum deflection of the beam under a given loading configuration
can be found using the methods of this chapter. Wherever possible, use
superposition and Appendix C. If it is not possible to use Appendix C
then the method of integration can be used instead. In either case the
equation for the maximum deflection of the beam will include the area
moment of inertia, I. Set the maximum allowable deflection equal to this
equation and replace \(I=\frac{b h^{3}}{12}\). We can then solve for the
required dimensions of the cross-section to not exceed the maximum
allowable deflection of the beam.

We now have three different dimensions---one required to not exceed the
maximum bending stress, one required to not exceed the maximum shear
stress, and one required to not exceed the maximum deflection. Since we
must not exceed any of these limitation, we select the largest of our
three potential answers. See \hyperref[example-11.8]{Example 11.8} for a
demonstration.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 11.8}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The simply supported wooden beam (E = 1700 ksi) of length L = 12 ft is
subjected to a uniform distributed load of w = 1.5 kips/ft.

Assume the beam has an allowable bending stress of 900 psi, an allowable
shear stress of 180 psi, and the deflection is limited to beam span /
240.

The beam has a rectangular cross-section where h = 1.5b. Determine the
minimum required dimensions of the beam's cross-section to meet these
specifications. Give your answer rounded up to the nearest inch to allow
for realistic manufacturing tolerances.

Start by drawing shear force and bending moment diagrams to determine
the maximum internal loads:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.35417in,height=\textheight]{images/CH11 PNGs/example11.8-2.png}
\end{center}

V\textsubscript{max} = 9 kips

M\textsubscript{max} = 27 kip·ft

Design for bending by using the minimum required section modulus,
S\textsubscript{min}:

\[
\begin{aligned} S_{\min }=\frac{M_{\max }}{\sigma_{\text {allow}}} & =\frac{27000 \times 12}{900}=360 \mathrm{~in.}^3 \\ 360=\frac{b h^2}{6} & =\frac{b(1.5b)^2}{6}=\frac{2.25 \mathrm{~b}^3}{6} \\ b & =9.805 \mathrm{~in.}\end{aligned}
\]

Design for shear:

\[
\begin{aligned} & \tau_{\text {max }}=\frac{3}{2} \frac{V}{A} \\ & 180=\frac{3}{2} \times \frac{9000}{A} \\ & A=\frac{3}{2} \times \frac{9000}{180}=b h=b(1.5 b)=1.5 b^2 \\ & b=7.071 \mathrm{~in.}\end{aligned}
\]

Design for deflection:

From Appendix C,

\[
y_{\max }=- \frac{5 w L^4}{384 E I}
\]

\[
\begin{gathered}-\frac{\text { Span }}{240}=-\frac{(12 \times 12)}{240}=-\frac{5 \times \frac{1500}{12} \times(12 \times 12)^4}{384 \times 1700000 \times I} \\ I=\frac{bh^3}{12}=\frac{b(1.5b)^3}{12}=\frac{3.375b^4}{12}=\frac{5 \times \frac{1500}{12}+(12 \times 12)^4}{384 \times 1700000} \times \frac{240}{12 \times 12} \\ b=7.028 \mathrm{~in.}\end{gathered}
\]

We must select the largest dimension in order to meet all these criteria

\[
\begin{aligned} & b_{\text {req }}=9.865 \mathrm{~in.} \\ & h_{\text {req }}=14.8 \mathrm{~in.}\end{aligned}
\]

To the next nearest inch:

\[
\begin{aligned} & b_{\text {req }}=10 \mathrm{~in.} \\ & h_{\text req }=15 \mathrm{~in.}\end{aligned}
\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Answer only}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

\[
\begin{aligned} & b_{\text {req }}=10 \mathrm{~in.} \\ & h_{\text req }=15 \mathrm{~in.}\end{aligned}
\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

For W beams we can again use the method of section 9.2 to select a beam
from Appendix A that meets the specifications for bending stress. Use
\(S_{\min }=\frac{M_{\max }}{\sigma_{\text {allow }}}\) and select a
beam with \(\mathrm{S}>\mathrm{S}_{\min }\).

Next determine the equation for the maximum deflection of the beam under
the given loading conditions. As before, use superposition and Appendix
C whenever possible. Set the maximum allowable deflection equal to this
equation and solve for the minimum required area moment of inertia,
\(I_{\min }\). Now select the lightest beam from Appendix A that meets
both \(S_{\min }\) and \(I_{\min }\).

Steel W beams rarely fail due to shear stress, but shear must still be
checked. An exact value for the maximum shear stress in the beam can be
found from \(\tau_{\max }=\frac{V Q}{I t}\). However, most of the shear
stress is resisted by the web of the beam. A reasonable estimate of the
maximum shear stress can be found using
\(\tau_{\text {estimate }}=\frac{V}{A_{w e b}}\). This calculation is
much simpler, but it is important to note that it is only an estimate.
In most cases the maximum shear stress will be significantly less than
the allowable shear stress and this estimate will suffice to demonstrate
that. In the rare case that the maximum shear stress is within 20\% of
the allowable shear stress, an exact value must be determined using
\(\tau_{\max }=\frac{V Q}{I t}\). The beam was already selected to meet
the bending stress and deflection requirements. As long as the maximum
shear stress is less than the allowable shear stress, the beam can be
used. See \hyperref[example-11.9]{Example 11.9} for a demonstration.

A steel (E = 210 GPa) W-beam of length L = 10 m will need to support the
load shown, where w = 5 kN/m and F = 100 kN.

Assume the beam has an allowable bending stress of 150 MPa, an allowable
shear stress of 100 MPa, and the maximum deflection is limited to 40 mm.

Select the lightest weight W-beam from Appendix A that meets these
specifications.

V\textsubscript{max} = 75 kN

M\textsubscript{max} = 312.5 kN·m

Design for bending by using the minimum required section modulus
S\textsubscript{min}:

\[
\begin{aligned}  S_{\text {min }}=\frac{M_{\text {max }}}{\sigma_{\text {Allow }}}=\frac{312.5 \times 10^3}{150 \times 10^6} & =0.002083 \mathrm{~m}^3 \\ & =2083 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~mm}^3 \\ & \end{aligned}
\]

Design for deflection:

We know the maximum deflection is limited to 40 mm (0.04 m) and the beam
will deflect downward. From Appendix C we can see the maximum deflection
for both the concentrated load and the distributed load occur in the
same place. We can therefore add the two maximum deflection equations
together and solve for the area moment of inertia.

\[
\begin{aligned} & \begin{aligned} y_{\text {max }} & = -0.04=-\frac{5 w L^4}{384 E^2 I}-\frac{F L^3}{48 E I} \\ I_{\text {req }}= & \frac{1}{0.04}\left[\frac{5 \times 5000 \times 10^4}{384 \times 210 \times 10^9}+\frac{100000 \times 10^3}{48 \times 210 \times 10^9}\right] \\ I_{\text {req }} & =0.0003255 \mathrm{~m}^4 \\ = & 325.5 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~mm}^4\end{aligned}\end{aligned}

Select lightest beam from Appendix A with

\[
\begin{aligned} & S>2083\times10^3 \mathrm{~mm}^3 \\ & I>325.5\times10^6 \mathrm{~mm}^4\end{aligned}
\]

Options include:

\[
\begin{aligned}&W310\times143\quad(S=2150\times10^3~mm^3,I=347\times10^6~mm^4)\\
&W360\times216\quad(S=3800\times10^3~mm^3,I=712\times10^6~mm^4)\\

&W610\times101\quad(S=2520\times10^3~mm^3,I=762\times10^6~mm^4)\end{aligned}
\]

Select the lightest of these beams.

\textbf{Use W610 x 101.}

Check the estimated shear stress to make sure that there's no risk of
exceeding the allowable shear stress:

\[
{\text { For }}W610\times 101, A_{w e b}=t_w d=0.0105 \times 0.602=0.006321 \mathrm{~m}^2\]\[\tau=\frac{v_{\text {max}}}{A_\text{web}}=\frac{75000}{0.006321}=11.9 \mathrm{~MPa}
\]

Since \(\tau_{Allow}=100 ~MPa\) this will be fine. The estimated shear
stress is not close to the allowable shear stress.

In section 4.7 we discussed the general state of stress. Figure 4.7
shows a 3D stress element subjected to the general state of stress --
that is, 3 normal stresses (σ\textsubscript{x}, σ\textsubscript{y}, and
σ\textsubscript{z)} and 6 shear stresses τ\textsubscript{xy},
τ\textsubscript{xz}, τ\textsubscript{yx} and τ\textsubscript{yz},
τ\textsubscript{zx} and τ\textsubscript{zy}.

Figure 4.8 shows a stress element for the simplified case of plane
stress -- that is, stresses acting in a single plane. Under plane
stress, the element experiences normal stresses σ\textsubscript{x} and
σ\textsubscript{y}, and shear stress τ\textsubscript{xy} =
τ\textsubscript{xz}.

These stress elements are a convenient way to show the stresses at a
particular orientation of the stress element, often in the x-y plane.
However, we sometimes want to know the stresses at different
orientations. For example, in section 2.4 we learned how to calculate
the stresses on inclined planes. There we were calculating the stresses
at specific orientations that were not in the x-y directions, but rather
at some angle relative to the x-y directions.

In this chapter we will develop a more general approach where we can
begin with the stresses in any given direction (usually starting with
the x-y directions is simplest) and use these stresses to calculate the
stresses at different orientations of the stress element. This process
is known as stress transformation.

In section 12.1 we will develop equations that allow us to begin with
normal and shear stresses in the x-y directions and transform them to
determine the stresses at any other orientation.

In section 12.2 we will expand on these equations in order to determine
the maximum and minimum stresses, as well as the orientations that they
occur at.

In section 12.3 we will discuss an alternative graphical method for
performing stress transformation, known as Mohr's circle.

In section 12.4 we will use Mohr's circle to expand our analysis and
look at the stresses not only in the original 2D plane, but also at the
out-of-plane stresses.

\section{Stress Transformations}\label{stress-transformations}

Click to expand

The choice of a coordinate system to use when calculating stresses for a
given loading condition is often chosen based on convenience, or what is
considered to be the most straight forward system for the given loading
directions and the geometrical orientation of the body. For example,
consider the simple case of an axial load applied to a rectangular bar
as shown in figure 12.1. It is convenient to use a coordinate system in
which one axis aligns with the longitudinal axis of the bar and the
other two axis aligned with the edges of the cross-section. With this
coordinate system, the general stress state can be quickly determined to
consist of only a normal stress in the x direction. We can represent the
state of stress at a given point, say point H, on a stress element.
Remember that this stress element is actually a 3D object even though we
typically draw a 2D plane view of the element.

\textbf{Figure 12.1: For simplicity, the x,y,z coordinate axes are
cbosen to line up with the direction of loading and the longitudinal
axis of the bar}

However, the coordinate systems that are the most straightforward to
base stress calculations on do not always represent the directions for
which the stress levels are the most critical. In the above example, if
the bar consists of two sections glued together at an angle, or if the
bar is made of wood or composite material with the grains or fibers
running at angle to the horizontal, one might be concerned with the
level of stress parallel and/or perpendicular to the joint surface (or
grains/fibers).

Figure 12.2 shows an air duct which is part of a heat pump system and is
subject to internal air pressure. Pressure vessels will be discussed in
chapter 13 and it will be shown that equations to calculate stress based
on pressure and geometrical parameters in the longitudinal and hoop
directions can be straightforwardly derived. However, as is the case for
the duct in the figure, pressure vessels can often be made with welded
seams wound in a helical pattern that forms an angle with the horizontal
and vertical axes. It would be important to know the stresses in the
directions parallel and perpendicular to these seams to ensure that the
joint could tolerate the loading.

\textbf{Figure 12.2: A pressurized duct is fabricated with welding in a
helical pattern}

Now we'll use trigonometry to develop a general set of equations to
transform stresses from one set of coordinate axes to another. Consider
a stress element representing the state of stress at a point in the
\emph{xy} plane as shown in figure 12.3. If we want to use the known
stresses in the \emph{xy} coordinate system to find the stresses
parallel and perpendicular to a different plane, represented by the
incline shown on the element, we can cut through the element at the
appropriate angle and consider the free body diagram on the cut section.
The FBD of the cut element shows the known stresses on the uncut sides
of the element and the unknown internal reaction normal and shear
stresses, σ\textsubscript{n} and τ\textsubscript{nt}, on the cut side of
the element. The internal reactions are represented in the directions
for which we want to know the stress state.

\textbf{Figure 12.3: Stress element cut along plane of interest}

Consider the area of the cut side of the element on which
σ\textsubscript{n} and τ\textsubscript{nt} act to be dA'. By applying
trigonometry we can say that the area of the side on which
σ\textsubscript{x} acts, dA\textsubscript{x}, is:

\[
d A_x=d A^{\prime}(\sin \beta)=d A^{\prime} \cos (\theta)
\]

and the area of the side on which σ\textsubscript{y} acts is:

\[
d A_x=d A^{\prime}(\cos \beta)=d A^{\prime} \sin (\theta)
\]

We can apply equilibrium to obtain expressions for σ\textsubscript{n}
and τ\textsubscript{nt} if we express the stress components as forces
and resolve those forces into the n and t directions. The force
corresponding to each direction of stress is obtained by multiplying the
stress with the area it acts on (i.e., the force corresponding to
σ\textsubscript{x} is σ\textsubscript{x}*dA\textsubscript{x}).

From σ\textsubscript{x} we have:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& F_n=-\sigma x^* d A x^* \cos (\theta)=-\sigma x^* d A^{\prime} \cos (\theta) \cos (\theta) \\
& \mathrm{Ft}=\sigma x^* \mathrm{~d} A x^* \sin (\theta)=\sigma x^* d A^{\prime} \cos (\theta) \sin (\theta)
\end{aligned}
\]

From σ\textsubscript{y} we have:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& F_n=-\sigma y^* d A y^* \sin (\theta)=-\sigma y^* d A^{\prime} \sin (\theta) \sin (\theta) \\
& F t=-\sigma y^* d A y^* \cos (\theta)=-\sigma y^* d A^{\prime} \cos (\theta) \sin (\theta)
\end{aligned}
\]

From the vertical shear stress acting on the x-face we have:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& F n=-\tau_{xy}{ }^* d A x^* \sin (\theta)=-\tau x y^* d A^{\prime} \cos (\theta) \sin (\theta) \\
& F t=-\tau_{xy}{ }^* d A x^* \cos (\theta)=-\tau x y^* d A^{\prime} \cos (\theta) \cos (\theta)
\end{aligned}
\]

From the horizontal shear stress acting on the y face we have:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Fn}=-\tau_{xy} *^* d A x^* \cos (\theta)=-\tau x y^* d^{\prime} \sin (\theta) \cos (\theta) \\
& F t=\tau_{xy}{ }^* d A y^* \sin (\theta)=\tau_{x y}^* d A^{\prime} \sin (\theta) \sin (\theta)
\end{aligned}
\]

Applying equilibrium in the n and t directions:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sum F_n=-\sigma_x * d A^{\prime} * \cos ^2(\theta)-\sigma_y * d A^{\prime} * \sin ^2(\theta)-2 \tau_{x y} * d A^{\prime} * \cos (\theta) \sin (\theta)=0 \\
\sum F_t=\sigma_x * d A^{\prime} * \cos (\theta) \sin (\theta)-\sigma_y * d A^{\prime} * \cos (\theta) \sin (\theta)+\tau_{x y} * d A^{\prime} *\left(\sin ^2(\theta)-\cos ^2(\theta)\right) \\
+\tau_{n t} d A^{\prime}=0
\end{gathered}
\]

Solving the equations for σ\textsubscript{n} and τ\textsubscript{nt} and
simplifying terms gives:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_n=\sigma_x \cos ^2(\theta)+\sigma_y \sin ^2(\theta)+2 \tau_{x y} \sin (\theta) \cos (\theta) \\
& \tau_{n t}=-\left(\sigma_x-\sigma_y\right) \cos (\theta) \sin (\theta)+\tau_{x y}\left(\cos ^2(\theta)-\sin ^2(\theta)\right)
\end{aligned}
\]

These equations are known as the \textbf{stress transformation
equations}.

Alternatively, implementing the trig identities:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\cos ^2(\theta)=\frac{1+\cos (2 \theta)}{2} \\
\sin ^2(\theta)=\frac{1-\cos (2 \theta)}{2} \\
\sin (2 \theta)=2 \sin (\theta) \cos (\theta) \\
\cos (2 \theta)=\cos ^2(\theta)-\sin ^2(\theta)
\end{gathered}
\]

the transformation equations can also be expressed as:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_n & =\frac{\sigma_x+\sigma_y}{2}+\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2} \cos (2 \theta)+\tau_{x y} \sin (2 \theta) \\
\tau_{n t} & =-\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2} \sin (2 \theta)+\tau_{x y} \cos (2 \theta)
\end{aligned}
\]

Either set of transformation equations will work. The choice over which
set to use is based on personal preference.

The stress transformation equations can be used to take a set of
stresses calculated in the chosen coordinate system (xy) and transform
them to a different coordinate system (\emph{x'y'}), as shown in Figure
12.4. With θ defined to be the angle between the x-axis and the normal
to the plane of interest as shown in Figure 3, the σ\textsubscript{n}
equation gives the stress on the rotated x-face, which we will call the
σ\textsubscript{x'}. To find σ\textsubscript{y'}, the normal stress on
the rotated y-face, we can simply sub an angle of (90° + θ) into the
σ\textsubscript{n} equation since the y' axis would be rotated an
additional 90° form the x-axis. Also note that substituting θ into the
τ\textsubscript{nt} equation gives τ\textsubscript{x'y'}.

\textbf{Figure 12.4: The angle θ is defined to be the angle between the
original x axis and the normal to the plane of interest. Subbing θ into
the stress transformation equations gives ~σx' and τ\textsubscript{x'y}
whle subbing in ( 90° + θ) gives σ\textsubscript{y'}.}

Another way to quickly determine the normal stress along the y' axis
once σ\textsubscript{x'} is known is to make use of the concept of
\ul{stress invariance} which is the idea that sum of the normal stresses
(σ\textsubscript{x} + σ\textsubscript{y}) remains constant regardless of
the plane in which they are calculated. Put another way, the stress
invariance principle allows us to say that (σ\textsubscript{x} +
σ\textsubscript{y}) = (σ\textsubscript{x'} + σ\textsubscript{y'}).

The angle of incline may be measured and given relative to a variety of
reference axes. It is imperative that one understands which angle to
substitute into the transformation equations given above. To ensure you
have the correct angle, take the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Draw a line that represents the plane of interest
\item
  Draw the x-axis positive going towards the right
\item
  Draw the axis normal to the plane of interest. It does not matter if
  you draw the normal axis as oriented counterclockwise or clockwise
  from the x-axis as long as you use the correct sign for the angle (see
  step 4).
\item
  Determine the angle that goes from the x-axis to the normal axis. This
  angle is θ. If the direction from the x-axis to the normal axis is
  counterclockwise, then θ should be taken to be positive. If the
  direction from the x-axis to the normal axis is clockwise, then θ
  should be taken to be negative.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Figure 5: Draw a sketch of the x-axis and the normal axis to
ensure you use the correct magnitude and sign for θ in the stress
transformation equations.}

Finally, one should note that the transformation equations were derived
based on stresses given in the the x-y plane where x is the horizontal
axis positive to the right and y is the vertical axis positive upwards.
If a plane other than the xy plane is being used for the general stress
calculations, or if the x and y axes are oriented in the opposite
configuration, the rule to follow would be to substitute the stress
normal to the vertical faces of the element in for the
σ\textsubscript{x} terms of the equations and the stress normal to the
horizontal faces of the element in the σ\textsubscript{y} terms of the
equations. For example, given the stress element in Figure 12.6, one
would substitute σ\textsubscript{z} = 90 MPa in for the σx terms of the
stress transformation equations, σ\textsubscript{x} = -150 MPa in for
the σ\textsubscript{y} terms, and τ\textsubscript{xz} = -16 MPa in for
the τ\textsubscript{xy} terms.

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Establish the angle θ that corresponds to the angle of rotation
  between the positive x-axis and the axis normal (x') to the plane of
  interest. Remember to make the angle negative if the rotation is
  clockwise from the x axis to the normal axis and positive if the
  rotation is counterclockwise.
\item
  Substitute in the stresses with appropriate sign and the angle θ with
  appropriate sign into the stress transformation equations to find
  σ\textsubscript{n} and τ\textsubscript{nt}. Remember that normal
  stresses are negative if compressive and positive if tensile, shear
  stresses are positive if the shear stress arrow on the positive x face
  points in the positive y direction and negative otherwise. This will
  give σ\textsubscript{x'} and τ\textsubscript{x'y'}.
\item
  Use (θ+90°) in the σ\textsubscript{n} transformation equation or the
  concept of stress invariance (σx + σy = σx' + σy') to find σy'.
\end{enumerate}

\end{tcolorbox}

Examples 12.1 and 12.2 below illustrate the use of the stress of
transformation equations.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 12.1:}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The general stress state at a point on a hollow pipe formed with spiral
welds inclined to an angle β with respect to the horizontal is shown
below. For stress magnitudes given as follows: Sx = 128 MPa,
\emph{S\textsubscript{y}} = 80 MPa, Sxy = 75.45 MPa, and β = 42°.
Determine the stress parallel and perpendicular to weld.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The stress parallel and perpendicular to the weld can be found by
applying the stress transformation equations with σ\textsubscript{x} =
128 MPa, σ\textsubscript{y} = 80 MPa, and τ\textsubscript{xy} = -75.45
MPa:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_n=\sigma_x \cos ^2(\theta)+\sigma_y \sin ^2(\theta)+2 \tau_{x y} \sin (\theta) \cos (\theta) \\
& \tau_{n t}=-\left(\sigma_x-\sigma_y\right) \cos (\theta) \sin (\theta)+\tau_{x y}\left(\cos ^2(\theta)-\sin ^2(\theta)\right)
\end{aligned}
\]

Notice that the normal stresses are positive since they are both shown
to be tensile on the given stress element but the shear stress is
negative based on the fact that the shear stress arrow goes in the
negative y direction on the positive x-face (the same conclusion can be
drawn by observing any of the other faces).

Before performing the calculation, the appropriate angle θ must also be
found. The plane of interest in this as is the plane of the weld which
is represented by the line representing the spiral. The angle θ needed
to substitute into the equations is the angle between the x-axis and th
normal axis to the weld. Based on the normal axis below the x-axis, we
can see θ is θ = -(90 -- β) = -48°. The angle is negative since it is a
clockwise rotation to get from the x axis to the n-axis below.

We could also base θ on the dashed normal axis, in which case the
magnitude of θ would be θ = 180° -- 48° = 132°. This angle is positive
since the rotation from the x-axis to the dashed normal axis is
counterclockwise.

{[}figure{]}

So with σ\textsubscript{x} = 128 MPa, σ\textsubscript{y} = 80 MPa,
τ\textsubscript{xy} = -75.45 MPa, and θ = -48° (or +132°), \textbf{the
stress normal to the weld is σ\textsubscript{n} = 139.0 MPa. The stress
parallel to the weld is τ\textsubscript{nt} = 31.76 MPa.}

The stresses shown act at a point in a stressed body as shown. Normal

\emph{S\textsubscript{y}} = 800 psi, and \emph{S\textsubscript{xy}} =
790 psi. Determine the normal (positive if tensile, negative if
compressive) and shear stresses at this point on the inclined plane
shown. Assume β = 36°.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

We will first determine the angle θ that we need for the stress
transformation equations. Recall the the process described in section
12.1:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Draw a line that represents the plane of interest
\item
  Draw the x-axis positive going towards the right
\item
  Draw the axis normal to the plane of interest. It does not matter if
  you draw the normal axis as oriented counterclockwise or clockwise
  from the x-axis as long as you use the correct sign for the angle (see
  step 4).
\item
  Determine the angle that goes from the x-axis to the normal axis. This
  angle is θ. If the direction from the x-axis to the normal axis is
  counterclockwise, then θ should be taken to be positive. If the
  direction from the x-axis to the normal axis is clockwise, then θ
  should be taken to be negative.
\end{enumerate}

{[}figure{]}

Either angle labeled θ in the illustration will work and produce the
same results. In this example, we will use the smaller of the two:

θ = 90 -- β = 54°.

The angle is positive since the n-axis is rotated counterclockwise from
the positive x-axis.

With θ determined, the only thing left to do is make the subsitutions
into the stress transformation equations and calculate. Note that the σn
equation will give us the normal stress on the rotated x-face (x'), so
will need to also calculate σn with the angle (θ + 90°) to get σy' or
use the stress invariance concept: (σx + σy = σx' + σy')

Substituting σ\textsubscript{x} = -1700 psi (negative since it is shown
to be compressive), σ\textsubscript{y} = 800 psi, τ\textsubscript{xy} =
790 psi, and θ = 54° into:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_n=\frac{\sigma_x+\sigma_y}{2}+\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2} \cos (2 \theta)+\tau_{x y} \sin (2 \theta) \\
& \tau_{n t}=-\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2} \sin (2 \theta)+\tau_{x y} \cos (2 \theta)
\end{aligned}
\]

Gives σ\textsubscript{x'} = 687.6 psi and τ\textsubscript{x'y'} = 945
psi.

Furthermore, applying stress invariance: -1700 psi + 800 psi = 687.6 psi
+ σ\textsubscript{y'} gives σ\textsubscript{y'} = -1588 psi

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{x'} = 687.6 psi}

\textbf{τ\textsubscript{x'y'} = 945 psi}

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{y'} = -1588 psi}

\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Principal Stresses and Max/Min Shear
Stress}\label{principal-stresses-and-maxmin-shear-stress}

Click to expand

Often, the orientation of plane we would be the most concerned with is
the one on which the normal stress or the shear stress is at a maximum
or minimum. The maximum and minimum normal stresses are referred to as
the principal stresses (σ\textsubscript{1} and σ\textsubscript{2}) and
the planes on which they act (described by angle of rotation of the
stress element, θ\textsubscript{p1} and θ\textsubscript{p2}) are the
principal planes. The maximum and minimum shear stresses are simply
referred to as the maximum and minimum shear stress, respectively, and
the planes on which they occur are referred to simply as the planes of
maximum and minimum shear stress (denoted as θ\textsubscript{s1} and
θ\textsubscript{s2}).

It is important to note that in this section, only rotations within a
two dimensional plane are being considered. As will be seen in section
12.4, the principal planes and principal stresses are the same even when
considering out of plane rotation of the stress element (see figure
12.7), but the max shear stress could be different. Therefore, the max
and min sheer stress as determined by the below derived equations will
be referred to as the max/min \emph{in-plane} shear stress.

\textbf{Figure 12.7: The max shear stress obtained from in-plane
rotations of the stress element may not be the same as the max shear
stress when considering out of plane rotation as well. This section
describes how to find the max/min in-plane shear stress.}

As we rotate the stress element and the angle θ changes, the stress
changes in a predictable way. Figure 12.8 shows the variation of normal
stress σx' with angle θ. The principal stresses can be seen to occur at
specific values of θ. These angles will be 90° apart from one another. A
similar graph could be drawn for τx'y'.

\textbf{Figure 12.8:} Plot showing how normal stress σx' varies with
angle θ.

Since these stresses are maximums and minimums (i.e., the slope of the
curve is zero at these points) and since the transformation equations
derived in section 12.1 are functions in terms of the plane rotation
angle θ, we can simply take the derivates of the two equations and set
them equal to zero to find the angles at which we would get the maximum
and minimum of each type of stress. Using the second set of
transformation equations derived in section 12.1 (though the first set
would yield the same results):

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{d \sigma_n}{d \theta}=-\left(\sigma_x-\sigma_y\right) \sin \left(2 \theta_p\right)+2 \tau_{x y} \cos \left(2 \theta_p\right)=0 \\
& \frac{d \tau_{n t}}{d \theta}=-\left(\sigma_x-\sigma_y\right) \cos \left(2 \theta_s\right)-2 \tau_{x y} \sin \left(2 \theta_s\right)=0
\end{aligned}
\]

Notice that θ is subscripted with a p in the first equation since this
theta represents a principal plane as defined above. Similarly, θ is
subscripted with and S in the second equation since this theta
represents a plane of max or min in-plane shear stress.

These equations can be rearranged to isolate Tan (2θ) on one side and
subsequently used to find θp and θs values:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\tan \left(2 \theta_p\right) & =\frac{2 \tau_{x y}}{\left(\sigma_x-\sigma_y\right)} \\
\tan \left(2 \theta_s\right) & =-\frac{\left(\sigma_x-\sigma_y\right)}{2 \tau_{x y}}
\end{aligned}
\]

Once the angles associated with the planes of extreme stresses are
determined, they can be substituted into the stress transformation
equation of section 12.1 along with the stresses in the given plane to
find the principal stresses and max/min shear stress.

A few calculation details that it will be helpful to remember are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The inverse tangent function has two possible solutions. One solution
  would be the angle that will be reported by a calculator, and the
  other possible answer is the angle that is that angle plus or minus
  180°. So if you use your calculator to solve the Tan (2θp) equation,
  you would take half that to get the first principle angle and then add
  or subtract 90 degrees to that principal angle to get the second. The
  same idea applies to finding the two θ\textsubscript{s} angles.
\item
  By convention, the \emph{most positive} of the two principal stresses
  is denoted as σ\textsubscript{1}. The other principal stress is then
  σ\textsubscript{2}. The angle that produces that σ\textsubscript{1}
  stress is θ\textsubscript{p1} and the angle that produces
  σ\textsubscript{2} is θ\textsubscript{p2}.
\item
  The max and min in-plane shear stresses will always turn out to be
  equal in magnitude by opposite in sign, or in other words, the minimum
  shear stress is always the negative of the maximum shear stress. As
  with the principal planes and stresses, one would need to substitute
  one of the θ\textsubscript{s} angles into the shear stress
  transformation equation to determine which angle corresponds to the
  maximum in-plane shear stress and which corresponds to the minimum.
\item
  The angles of maximum and minimum shear stresses are 90° apart from
  each other, and 45° apart from the principal directions. If one
  principal direction is found to be, for example, 40° then the other
  principal direction can be determined as either (40° + 90° =) 130° or
  (40° - 90° =) -50°. The angles of maximum and minimum in-plane shear
  stress can then be determined as either (40° + 45° =) 95° or (40° -
  45° =) - 5°. It is also acceptable to add or subtract 45° from 130° or
  from -- 50°.
\item
  Given the variety of different of possible correct angles, we will use
  a convention that principal directions and angles of maximum and
  minimum shear stress will be calculated in the range -- 90° ≤ θ ≤ +
  90°.
\end{enumerate}

If desired, the principal stresses and max./min. shear stresses can be
calculated directly without first finding the principal directions:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{1,2}=\frac{\sigma_x+\sigma_y}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2}\right)^2+\tau_{x y}{ }^2} \\
\tau_{x \prime y^{\prime}}= \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2}\right)^2+\tau_{x y}{ }^2}
\end{gathered}
\]

Some useful conclusions that can be drawn simply by studying the
principal plane and plane of max/min shear stress equations are as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  If the shear stress transformation equation given in Section 12.1 is
  set equal to 0 in order to find the plane at which shear stress is
  equal to 0, we would arrive at the same equation as the
  Tan(2θ\textsubscript{p}) found above. We can then conclude that
  \ul{shear stress is 0 on the principal planes}. It can also be said
  that if the shear stress is found to be 0 on any given plane, then
  that plane must be a principal plane.
\item
  The equation for Tan(2θ\textsubscript{s}) is the negative inverse of
  the equation for Tan (2θ\textsubscript{p}). This means that
  2θ\textsubscript{s} = 2θ\textsubscript{p} ± 90° or θ\textsubscript{s}
  = θ\textsubscript{p} ± 45°. Recognizing this can allow one to
  calculate one set of angles more efficiently once the other is found.
\item
  If either of the θ\textsubscript{s} angles are substituted into the
  normal stress transformation equation, the normal stress would work
  out to be the average stress
  \(\left(\frac{\left(\sigma_x+\sigma_y\right)}{2}\right)\). Once again,
  this recognition can help make determining the total stress state on
  the plane of max/min shear stress more efficient.

The state of plane stress at a point is represented by the stress
element below. Determine the principal stresses and the maximum in-plane
shear stress and draw the corresponding stress elements.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Following the steps given at the end of section 12.2:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Find the principal planes using\\
  \[
  \operatorname{Tan}\left(2 \theta_p\right)=\frac{2 \tau_{x y}}{\left(\sigma_x-\sigma_y\right)}
  \]\\
  \strut \\
  With σ\textsubscript{x} = -80 MPa, σ\textsubscript{y} = 50 MPa, and
  τ\textsubscript{xy} = -25 MPa, we get:

  θp = 10.52° based on the answer from the calculator.

  The other angle is then θp = 10.52° + 90° = 100.52°

  So the principal plane angles are 10.52° and 100.52°.
\item
  Subbing θ\textsubscript{p} = 10.52° into:\\
  \[
  \sigma_n=\frac{\sigma_x+\sigma_y}{2}+\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2} \cos (2 \theta)+\tau_{x y} \sin (2 \theta)
  \]

  gives σ\textsubscript{n} = -84.6 MPa and subbing θ\textsubscript{p} =
  100.52° in gives σ\textsubscript{n} = 54.6 MPa.

  Since 54.6 MPa is the most positive of the two principal stresses,
  σ\textsubscript{1} = 54.6 MPa and σ\textsubscript{2} = -84.6 MPa.

  The 54.6 MPa would go on the rotated x-face and the -85.6 MPa would go
  on the rotated y-face of the stress element rotated counterclockwise
  100.52°.\\
  \strut \\
  Conversely, if the stress element is rotated counterclockwise by
  10.52°, the stress on the rotated x-face would be -84.6 MPa and the
  stress on the rotated y-face would be 54.6 MPa.

  Drawing the stress element rotated to the principal planes:\\
  {[}figure{]}\\
  Notice that the stress element looks the same no matter which angle is
  used for the rotation. Also note that the shear stress on the
  principal plane is 0.
\item
  Next we will find the planes of max/min in-plane shear planes as well
  as the corresponding shear stresses. We could use:\\
  \[
  \operatorname{Tan}\left(2 \theta_s\right)=-\frac{\left(\sigma_x-\sigma_y\right)}{2 \tau_{x y}}
  \]

  But since we already have the θ\textsubscript{p} angles, we will use
  the fact that the max/min in-plane shear stress planes are +/- 45°
  from those. We can choose either θ\textsubscript{p} angle to add and
  subtract the 45° to and from. The final orientation of the element
  would be the same. Since it is generally easier to visualize angle
  rotations smaller in magnitude than 90, so we will use the smaller
  θ\textsubscript{p} value.\\
  So θ\textsubscript{s} = 10.52° +/- 45° = 55.5° and -34.5°.
\item
  Subbing θ\textsubscript{s} = 55.5° into:\\
  \[
  \tau_{n t}=-\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2} \sin (2 \theta)+\tau_{x y} \cos (2 \theta)
  \]

  gives τ\textsubscript{nt} = 69.6 MPa. Since this is a positive value,
  we know that this is the max in-plane shear stress and that θs = -34.5
  ° should give τnt = -69.6 MPa = τ\textsubscript{min} (in-plane).

  So if we rotate the stress element counterclockwise by 55.5°, we would
  draw a positive shear stress and if we rotate it clockwise 34.5
  degrees, we would draw a negative shear stress.
\item
  The normal stress on the plane of max/min in-plane shear stress is\\
  \[
  \sigma=\sigma_{\text {avg }}=\frac{\left(\sigma_x+\sigma_y\right)}{2}=-15 \mathrm{MPa}
  \]
\end{enumerate}

Drawing the stress rotated to the planes of max/min shear stress:

{[}figure{]}

Once again, notice that the stress element looks fundamentally the same
regardless of which θ\textsubscript{s} angle is used.

\textbf{θ\textsubscript{p1} = 100.52° and θ\textsubscript{p2} = 10.52°}

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{1} = 54.6 MPa and σ\textsubscript{2} = - 84.6
MPa}

\textbf{θ\textsubscript{s} = 55.5° and -34.5°}

\textbf{τ\textsubscript{max} (in-plane) = 69.6 MPa}

\textbf{τ\textsubscript{min} (in-plane) = - 69.6 MPa}

\textbf{Elements are drawn above.}

Given a general stress state (σx, σy, and τxy) at a point in the x-y
plane where x is the horizontal axis positive to the right and y is the
vertical axis positive upwards:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Use the Tan(2θ\textsubscript{p}) equation to find the planes of
  principal stresses. The angle reported by the calculator provides
  twice one of the angles. The other is determined by adding or
  subtracting 90° from the first.
\item
  Substitute the two θ\textsubscript{p} angles into the
  σ\textsubscript{n} transformation equation to determine the principal
  stresses. The most positive of the two is deemed σ\textsubscript{1}
  and the other is σ\textsubscript{2}. Alternatively, only sub one of
  the angles into the stress transformation to get one of the principal
  stresses. The other principal stress can be calculated using stress
  invariance.
\item
  Use the Tan(2θ\textsubscript{s}) equation to find the planes of
  max/min in-plane shear stress. Alternatively, add/subtract 45° to one
  of the principal plane angles.
\item
  Substitute one of the θs angles into the τ\textsubscript{nt} equation
  to determine whether it leads to the max in-plane shear stress or the
  min. The other angle will lead to a shear stress of equal magnitude
  but opposite sign.
\item
  Calculate the average stress. This stress is the normal stress on the
  x' and y' faces when the element is rotated to the planes of max/min
  in-plane shear stress.

\section{Mohr's Circle}\label{mohrs-circle}

Click to expand

As an alternative to using equations to determine principal planes and
stresses as well as max/min shear planes and stresses, one can use a
graphical method known as Mohr's Circle. The stress transformation
equations can be seen to actually be equations of a circle where the
perimeter of the circle consists of coordinates points that correspond
to normal stress on the horizontal axis and shear stress on the vertical
axis. The advantage of using Mohr's Circle is that it does not involve
needing to recall equations and can be quick and efficient to use with
some practice.

To construct the circle (refer to the fully constructed Mohr's circle in
figure 12.9):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  To start, draw a set of coordinate axes where normal stress will be on
  the horizontal axis and shear stress will be on horizontal axis. Note
  in 12.9 that the shear stress is labeled with a (CW) for clockwise on
  the positive side and a (CCW) for counterclockwise on the negative
  side as a reminder of how the signs on the vertical coordinates are
  determined.
\item
  Plot the center of the circle, C, which will lie on the normal stress
  axis at a point equal to the average normal stress.\\
  \[
  C=\left(\frac{\sigma_x+\sigma_y}{2}, 0\right)
  \]
\item
  Next, one coordinate point on the circle needs to be established based
  on the given stress state and plotted on the axes. This point, which
  we will call the \ul{x-point,} will come from the stresses drawn on
  the positive x-face of the stress element. The normal stress is
  positive if tensile and negative if compressive. The sign on the
  vertical coordinate, the shear stress, will depend on the direction of
  rotation that the shear stress on the x-face will cause. If it would
  tend to rotate the element clockwise, it will be plotted on the
  positive side of the vertical axis and vice versa.

  On the representative stress element below, the normal stress on the x
  face is tensile and the upwards shear stress would tend to cause the
  element rotate counterclockwise, so the x-point is
  (+σ\textsubscript{x}, -τ\textsubscript{xy}).\\
  \textbf{Figure\\
  }We could alternatively use what we will call the y-point, which comes
  from the stresses acting on the positive y-face of the stress element
  with the same sign conventions above. For the representative stress
  element, the normal stress on the y face is drawn in the tensile
  direction and the rightwards shear stress would tend to cause the
  element to rotate clockwise, so the y-point is ((+σ\textsubscript{y},
  +τ\textsubscript{xy}).\\
  \textbf{Figure}
\item
  Once the center and either the x-point or y-point are plotted, draw a
  line that connects them. This line is the radius of the circle. This
  radius, R, can be determined using of the Pythagorean Theorem on the
  triangle formed between C, σ\textsubscript{x}, and the x-point. Since
  the radius of the circle will be constant, we can now draw the rest of
  the circle.\\
  \[
  R=\sqrt{\left(\sigma_x-C\right)^2+\tau_{x y}^2}
  \]
\item
  Recalling that the shear stress is zero on the principal plane, we can
  observe that that corresponds exactly to the normal stress axis so we
  can identify σ\textsubscript{1} to be the normal stress on the right
  extreme of the circle and σ\textsubscript{2} to be the normal stress
  on the left extreme of the circle. Furthermore, based on inspection of
  the circle and the known points, we can see that σ\textsubscript{1} =
  C + R and σ\textsubscript{2} = C - R.
\item
  It can also be seen that the max and min in-plane shear stress would
  be at the bottom and top of the circle, respectively, so we can say
  that τ\textsubscript{max} = +R and τ\textsubscript{min} = -R.

  The max shear stress is at the bottom since a positive shear stress on
  the positive x-face would cause the stress element to rotate
  counterclockwise.

  The circle also confirms that the normal stress on the plane of
  max/min in-plane shear stress is
  \(\mathrm{C}=\sigma_{\text {avg }}=\frac{\sigma_x+\sigma_y}{2}\)
\item
  To find the angles of the principal planes and max/min shear stress,
  or to use the circle to perform stress transformations to arbitrary
  planes, one must note that rotations around the circle represent twice
  the actual amount of rotation required to get from the stress state in
  one plane to the stress state in the rotated plane. Furthermore,
  rotations counterclockwise from the x-point are considered to be
  positive angles and the rotations clockwise from the x-point are
  considered to be negative angles.

  Thus, the angle between the radial line that connects C and the
  x-point to the principal plane (normal stress axis) is 2θp. This angle
  can be determined by applying right triangle trigonometry principles
  to the right triangle used to find the radius:\\
  \[
  \tan (2 \theta p)=\frac{C+\sigma_x}{\tau_{x y}}
  \]\\
  As discussed in section 12.2, the inverse tangent function will have
  two solutions. One of those solutions (divided by 2) will be the angle
  that corresponds to rotating from the x point to the σ1 side of the
  circle from which means that this principal angle leads to σ1 acting
  on the rotated x face (x' face) of the stress element and therefore
  σ\textsubscript{2} acts on the rotated y face (y' face). The other
  solution to θ\textsubscript{p} will correspond to the angle necessary
  to rotate from the x point to the σ2 side of the circle which will
  lead to σ\textsubscript{2} acting on the x' face and σ1 acting on the
  y' face.
\item
  The angle to the plane of max/min in-plane shear stress can be found
  in a similar manner. By visual inspection one can see that the
  tan(2θs) will be the inverse of tan(2θp). Alternatively, it can be
  calculated as 2θs = 90° - 2θp. One should note, however, the
  directions of the angles for rotation. ~Recalling the convention used
  to apply sign to the shear stress coordinate, the angle that goes from
  the x-point to the negative side of the shear stress axis will
  correspond to the rotation that results in the maximum in-plane shear
  stress and vice versa.
\item
  Once these quantities are known, the use of the circle to perform
  stress transformations at arbitrary planes requires making similar
  trigonometric calculations. This process is better illustrated in
  example 12.4.

\section{Mohr's Circle in 3-Dimensions and Absolute Max Shear
Stress}\label{mohrs-circle-in-3-dimensions-and-absolute-max-shear-stress}

Click to expand

The methods discussed so far in sections 12.2 and 12.3 provide the
maximum in-plane shear stress that arises from planar rotations in the
2D plane, but as discussed in section 12.2, the actual maximum shear
stress may result from an out of plane rotation. Thus, while this text
is generally restricted to planar (2D) stress states, we need to
consider a 3D stress element in order to determine the absolute maximum
shear stress.

However, we are still considering only cases in which the stresses act
in just two of the three principal directions. For the sake of this
discussion, we will say that the stresses act in only the x and y
directions, though it could generally be any combination of two axes. If
stresses act only in the x and y directions, then a 3D stress element
would include these stresses on the x and y faces, but the normal stress
on the z face would be zero and the shear stress in the \emph{xz} and
\emph{yz} planes would also be zero (see figure 12.10). Recalling the
earlier finding that if the shear stress is 0 on a given plane, the
plane is a principal plane, we can say that the \emph{xz} plane and the
\emph{yz} planes are principal planes with respect to rotation of the
element around the y and x axes respectively.

It we start with the stress element already rotated in the xy plane to
one of its principal planes, we know that the stresses on the x and y
faces in this plane (x' and y' faces) will be σ1 and σ2 or vice versa.
This means that σ\textsubscript{1} (or σ\textsubscript{2}) and
σ\textsubscript{z} are the principal stresses on the yz plane and the
σ\textsubscript{1} (or σ\textsubscript{2}) and σ\textsubscript{z} are
the principal stresses on the \emph{xz} plane. Since we are still
dealing with plane stress, we know that σ\textsubscript{z} = 0. In the
case of plane stress then, there are principal stresses
σ\textsubscript{1} and σ\textsubscript{2} as above, as well as
σ\textsubscript{3} = 0.

\textbf{Figure 12.10: 3D stress element with stress acting in only 2 or
the 3 principal directions.}

We can draw Mohr's circle for each of these three planes on one plot. We
will consider three cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  σ1 and σ2 on based on the xy plane are both positive
\item
  σ1 and σ2 on based on the xy plane are both negative
\item
  σ1 and σ2 on based on the xy plane are opposite signs
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Case 1}\label{case-1}

Referring to figure 12.11, the larger inner circle is Mohr's circle for
the xy plane as can be noted by the fact that the max and min normal
stresses on that circle are σ1 and σ2, respectively. The smaller inner
circle is Mohr's circle for either the xz or the yz plane (whichever one
has σ2 as the principal stress on the non-z face). The largest circle is
Mohr's circle for the other of the two non xy planes. We can see in this
case that the largest shear stress is given by the radius of the largest
circle which is σ1/2.

So in the case that σ1 and σ2 are both positive, the absolute max shear
stress is:

\[
\tau(\max )_{\text {absolute }}=\left|\frac{\sigma_1}{2}\right|
\]

The absolute value is there since we now the max shear stress must be a
positive shear stress given that the max and min shear stresses are
negatives of each other.

\textbf{Figure 12.11: The three planes represented on Mohr's circle for
the case where both the principal stresses in the xy plane are
positive.}

\subsection{Case 2}\label{case-2}

Referring to figure 12.12, all the statements made in Case 1 still hold
true except that the radius of the largest circle is now σ2/2.

So in the case that σ1 and σ2 are both positive, the absolute max shear
stress is:

\[
\tau(\max )_{\text {absolute }}=\left|\frac{\sigma_2}{2}\right|
\]

\textbf{Figure 12.12: The three planes represented on Mohr's circle for
the case where both the principal stresses in the xy plane are
negative.}

\subsection{Case 3}\label{case-3}

Referring to figure 12.13, this case is different than the other two
because in this case, the Mohr's circle for the xy plane is the largest
circle. This means that the absolute max shear stress and the maximum
in-plane shear stress are the same.

So in the case that σ\textsubscript{1} and σ\textsubscript{2} are
opposite in sign, the absolute max shear stress is:

\[
\tau(\max )_{\text {absolute }}=\left|\frac{\sigma_1-\sigma_2}{2}\right|
\]

\textbf{Figure 12.13: The three planes represented on Mohr's circle for
the case where the principal stresses in the xy plane are opposite
signs.}

More generally, given principal stresses σ\textsubscript{1},
σ\textsubscript{2}, and σ\textsubscript{3} = 0, the abosulte maximum
shear stress can be determined from:

\[
\tau(\max )_{\text {absolute }}=\left|\frac{\sigma_{\max }-\sigma_{\min }}{2}\right|
\]

This works for any of the cases above:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Case 1: σ\textsubscript{max} = σ\textsubscript{1},
  σ\textsubscript{min} = 0
\item
  Case 2: σ\textsubscript{max} = 0, σ\textsubscript{min} =
  σ\textsubscript{2}
\item
  Case 3: σ\textsubscript{ma}x = σ\textsubscript{1},
  σ\textsubscript{min} = σ\textsubscript{2}
\end{itemize}

Following the steps given in section 12.3:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The step of drawing the axes will be done as a part of step 3.
\item
  Identify and plot the x-point: Looking at the positive x-face, the
  normal stress is compressive, so the horizontal coordinate will be -60
  MPa. The shear stress arrow is upwards, which would tend to rotate the
  element counterclockwise, so the vertical coordinate will be negative,
  or -30 MPa. The x-point is then (-60,-30) MPa\\
  {[}figure{]}\\
  Identify and plot the y-point: Looking at the positive y-face, the
  normal stress is tensile, so the horizontal coordinate will be +15
  MPa. The shear stress arrow is to the right, which would tend to
  rotate the element clockwise, so the vertical coordinate will be
  positive, or +30 MPa. The y-point is then (15,30) MPa.\\
  {[}figure{]}\\
  The points are shown plotted in step 3.
\item
  Connect the two points on the circle and identify the center.\\
  \[
  C=\frac{\sigma_x+\sigma_y}{2}=\frac{-60+15}{2}=-22.5 \mathrm{MPa}
  \]\\
  {[}figure{]}
\item
  The radius of the circle is:
  \(R=\sqrt{\left(\sigma_x-C\right)^2+\tau_{x y}^2}=\sqrt{(-60-(-22.5))^2+30^2}=48.02 \mathrm{MPa}\)
\item
  We can now find σ1 by finding the distance from the origin to the
  rightmost point of the circle on the σ axis. Since C is negative, we
  can find distance to be C + R = -22.5 MPa + 48.02 MPa = 25.52 MPa.

  So σ\textsubscript{1} = 25.5 MPa

  We can find σ2 by finding the distance from the origin to the leftmost
  point of the circle on the σ axis. This distance can be expressed as
  C- R ~= -48.02 MPa -- 22.5 MPa = -70.52 MPa

  So σ\textsubscript{2} = -70.5 MPa
\item
  The max in-plane shear stress is the bottom most point of the circle
  which is simply R = 48.02 MPa, or τmax (in-plane) = 48.0 MPa.

  The normal stress on this plane is C = -22.5 MPa
\item
  The principal planes can be found as:
  \(\operatorname{Tan}(2 \theta p)=\frac{\sigma_x-C}{\tau_{x y}}=\frac{-60 M P a-(-22.5 M P a)}{30 M P a}\)\\
  One solution to this equation yields θp = -25.67°. This is the angle
  of rotation for which σ2 would be shown on the rotated x face. Note
  the negative angle means this would be a clockwise rotation.

  The other solution to the equation is that angle plus 90°, which in
  this case yields θp = 64.33°. This is the angle of rotation for which
  σ1 would appear on the rotated x-face. The positive angle indicates
  this would be a counterclockwise rotation.\\
  {[}figure{]}
\item
  With the θp angles known, we can see that the 2θs = 90 - 2θp, or θs =
  19.33° and -70.67°. In this case, a counterclockwise rotation of the
  x-point would bring it to the negative side of the vertical axis which
  corresponds to τmax, so we can say that θs = 19.33° is the plane of
  max in-plane shear stress.\\
  {[}figure{]}
\item
  Now we can use Mohr's Circle to find the stress state on the plane
  where the stress element is rotated clockwise 40°. The circle is
  redrawn below for convenience.

  Recalling that rotations around the circle are twice the actual
  rotation, we will draw in a point (denoted as x') that represents an
  80 degree rotation clockwise from the x-point. Since we know from step
  7 that the x-point is rotated 2* 25.7° below σ2, we also know that x'
  is rotated 80 -- 50.4 = 29.6° above σ\textsubscript{2}.\\
  {[}figure{]}\\
  Since x' is on the negative σ side and the positive τ side, we know
  that the normal stress on the x' face is compressive and the shear
  stress arrow on the x' face would tend to rotate the element clockwise
  (which corresponds to a negative shear stress).

  We can see from the circle that the shear stress is:

  τ\textsubscript{x'y'} = -Rsin(29.6°) = -48.02 MPa*sin(29.6°) = -23.7
  MPa

  and σ\textsubscript{x'} = C -Rcos(29.6°) = -22.5 MPa - 48.02
  MPa*cos(29.6°) = -64.3 MPa

  The stress on the rotated y face, σ\textsubscript{y'}, is obtained by
  finding the distance from the origin to the y' point which is directly
  across the circle from x'.

  σ\textsubscript{y'} = C + Rcos(29.6°) ~= -22.5 MPa + 48.02
  MPa*cos(29.6°) = 19.3 MPa

  The rotated stress element can be drawn:\\
  {[}figure{]}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{1} = 25.5 MPa on the principal plane
θ\textsubscript{p} = 64.3°}

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{2} = -70.5 MPa on the principal plane
θ\textsubscript{p} = -25.7°}

\textbf{τ\textsubscript{max} (in-plane) = 48.0 MPa on the plane
θ\textsubscript{s} = 19.33°}

On the plane rotated 40° clockwise from the given plane:

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{x'} = - 64.3 MPa}

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{y'} = 19.3 MPa}

\textbf{τ\textsubscript{x'y'} = -23.7 MPa}

Stress transformation equations can be used to take stresses calculated
in a specific plane and determine the stresses on a different plane of
interest. These types of transformation calculations could be necessary
when multiple planes of interest are involved such as when material
properties vary with direction or off axis connections are used. Mohr's
Circle provides a more graphical method that can also be used and
requires minimal need to recall equations.

One can also use specific equations or Mohr's Circle to determine the
planes of max/min normal stress and shear stress and the corresponding
stress values.

For planar (2D) loading conditions, principal (max/min normal stresses)
stresses will not be affected by out of plane rotations, so those values
can be calculated in the given plane. However, to determine the absolute
max/min shear stress, out of plane rotations must be considered. The
determination of the absolute max or min shear stress can ultimately be
made based on the signs and values of the principal stresses.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-13}

Click to expand

Pressure vessels are storage tanks that are used for storing fluids at
high pressure and they must be designed to resist this pressure. They
are commonly found in factories, power plants, vehicles, and even your
own home. Figure 13.1 shows some common applications.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.22917in,height=\textheight]{images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.1.png}

}

\caption{Figure 13.1: Some common examples of pressure vessels. (A)
standard home water heater; (B) industrial compressed gas storage; (C)
propellant tank for aerospace applications; (D) butane tank for home
use.}

\end{figure}%

Pressure vessels are necessarily hollow, and a thin-walled pressure
vessel is one where the ratio:

\[
\frac{\text { Inner radius }}{\text { W all thickness }}>10
\]

This implies that the wall thickness is relatively small compared to the
vessel radius. This simplifies our analysis in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We can assume that stresses in the vessel walls are uniform across the
  thickness of the wall
\item
  We can ignore stress in the radial direction (perpendicular to the
  vessel wall)
\end{enumerate}

As we'll see in this chapter, stresses are generated in the walls of
thin-walled pressure vessels in two directions known as the axial stress
and hoop stress (figure 13.2). There is a 3\textsuperscript{rd} stress
in the radial direction but this is very small compared to the other
stresses and is assumed to be zero in this text.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.26042in,height=\textheight]{images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.2.png}

}

\caption{Figure 13.2: A stress element on the wall of a thin-walled
pressure vessel. Stresses exist in the axial and hoop directions. The
radial stress is very small in comparison and is assumed to be zero.}

\end{figure}%

As seen in figure 13.1, thin-walled pressure vessels are commonly either
cylindrical or spherical. Section 13.1 will discuss the stresses in
cylindrical vessels. Section 13.2 will discuss the stresses in spherical
vessels.

\section{Cylindrical Pressure
Vessels}\label{cylindrical-pressure-vessels}

Click to expand

The equations stresses in the wall of a cylindrical pressure vessel can
be derived with the help of a free body diagram. Let's cut a
cross-section through our vessel to expose the fluid inside (figure
13.3).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=6.22917in,height=\textheight]{images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.3.png}

}

\caption{Figure 13.3: Cross-section through the cylindrical vessel
showing the axial stress in the walls (𝜎𝐴) and the fluid pressure P.}

\end{figure}%

There will be an axial stress from the internal fluid pressure (P) and
an axial stress in the walls of the vessel (𝜎\textsubscript{𝐴}). Since
\(\text{stress}=\frac{\text { force }}{\text { area }}\) we can
determine the two forces. The fluid pressure acts over a circular area
\(A=\pi r_i^2\). The stress in the walls acts over an area equal to the
circumference of the vessel multiplied by the wall thickness,
\(A=2 \pi r_i t\).

By equilibrium:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sum F_x=0 \\
& \left(\sigma_A\right)\left(2 \pi r_i t\right)-(P)\left(\pi r_i^2\right)=0 \\
& \sigma_A=\frac{P r_i}{2 t}
\end{aligned}
\]

where

\begin{itemize}
\item
  𝜎\textsubscript{𝐴} = Axial stress in the wall of the vessel {[}Pa,
  psi{]}
\item
  P = Fluid pressure inside the vessel {[}Pa, psi{]}
\item
  \emph{r\textsubscript{i}} = Inner radius of the vessel {[}m, in{]}
\item
  t = Wall thickness of the vessel {[}m, in{]}
\end{itemize}

Similarly there will be a stress in the lateral direction, referred to
as the hoop stress 𝜎\textsubscript{H}. Let's cut a vertical
cross-section (figure 13.4) to derive an equation for this stress.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.30208in,height=\textheight]{images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.4.png}

}

\caption{Figure 13.4: Cross-section through the cylindrical vessel
showing the hoop stress in the walls (𝜎\textsubscript{H}) and the fluid
pressure P.}

\end{figure}%

There will again be a stress from the internal fluid pressure (P) and a
stress in the walls of the vessel (𝜎\textsubscript{H}). The fluid
pressure acts over an area of \(A=2 r_i L\). The stress in the walls
acts over an area of \(A=2 t L\).

By equilibrium:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sum F_x=0 \\
\left(\sigma_H\right)(2 t L)-(P)\left(2 r_i L\right)=0 \\
\sigma_H=\frac{P r_i}{t}
\end{gathered}
\]

where

\begin{itemize}
\item
  𝜎\textsubscript{H} = Hoop stress in the wall of the vessel {[}Pa,
  psi{]}
\item
  P = Fluid pressure inside the vessel {[}Pa, psi{]}
\item
  \emph{r\textsubscript{i}} = Inner radius of the vessel {[}m, in{]}
\item
  t = Wall thickness of the vessel {[}m, in{]}
\end{itemize}

The internal pressure P is typically reported as the gage pressure,
which is defined as the internal pressure minus the atmospheric
pressure. This allows us to calculate the stresses directly without
needing to account for atmospheric pressure.

Since the radial stress is assumed to be zero, the axial and hoop
stresses represent a state of plane stress such as those discussed in
chapter 12. Further, since there is no shear stress, the axial and hoop
stresses represent the principal stresses. Since the hoop stress is
larger, this is the first principal stress (𝜎\textsubscript{1}). The
axial stress is the second principal stress (𝜎\textsubscript{2}). The
third principal stress acts in the radial direction and has already been
assumed to be zero. Figure 13.5 shows a plane stress element
representing the stresses in the wall of a cylindrical thin-walled
pressure vessel.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.17708in,height=\textheight]{images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.5.png}

}

\caption{Figure 13.5: The hoop stress represents the first principal
stress 𝜎\textsubscript{1}. The axial stress represents the second
principal stress 𝜎\textsubscript{2}. There is no shear stress.}

\end{figure}%

By the methods of chapter 12 we may perform stress transformation on
these stresses. Figure 13.6 shows Mohr's Circle for the in-plane and
out-of-plane stresses.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4.19792in,height=\textheight]{images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.6.png}

\caption{Figure 13.6: Mohr's Circle for the stresses in the walls of a
cylindrical thin-walled pressure vessel, showing principal stresses
𝜎\textsubscript{1} and 𝜎\textsubscript{2}. The 3rd principal stress
𝜎\textsubscript{3} = 0.}

\end{figure}%

Since the two principal stresses are positive and the third principal
stress is zero it should be apparent that the maximum in plane shear
stress can be determined as:

\[
\tau_{\text {max } \text { in-plane }}=\frac{\sigma_1-\sigma_2}{2}
\]

It should also be apparent that the maximum out-of-plane shear stress
will be larger and can be calculated from:

\[
\tau_{\max a b s}=\frac{\sigma_1}{2}
\]

Example 13.1 demonstrates calculation of the principal stresses and
maximum in-plane shear stress for a cylindrical thin-walled pressure
vessel. Example 13.2 combine the content from this section with stress
transformation from chapter 12 in order to find the stresses at specific
orientations.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 13.1: Needs title}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A cylindrical pressure vessel has an outer diameter of 8 ft and a wall
thickness of 2 inches. The vessel contains propane at a gage pressure of
250 psi. Determine the principal stresses and maximum in-plane shear
stress in the walls of the vessel.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

First determine the inner radius of the vessel. It will be easiest to
convert this to inches since the other length units in the problem are
given in inches.

Outer radius, \emph{r\textsubscript{o}} = 8 \emph{ft}/2 = 4 \emph{ft} =
48 \emph{in}

Inner radius, \emph{r\textsubscript{i}} = 48 - 2 = 46 \emph{in}

Now calculate the axial and hoop stresses.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_A=\frac{P r_i}{2 t}=\frac{250 * 46}{2 * 2}=2,875 \mathrm{psi} \\
& \sigma_H=\frac{P r_i}{t}=\frac{250 * 46}{2}=5,750 \mathrm{psi}
\end{aligned}
\]

Since there is no shear stress, these are the principal stresses.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_1=5,750 p s i \\
& \sigma_2=2,875 p s i
\end{aligned}
\]

Finally, the maximum in-plane shear stress can be found from:

\[
\tau_{\max \text { in plane }}=\frac{\sigma_1-\sigma_2}{2}=\frac{5,750-2,875}{2}=1,438 \mathrm{psi}
\]

\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 13.2: Needs title}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A cylindrical pressure vessel is made by welding steel plate at an angle
of 𝜃=25° as shown. The vessel has an outer diameter of 1.5 m and a wall
thickness of 40 mm. The vessel contains fluid at a gage pressure of 5
MPa. Determine the normal stress perpendicular to the weld and the shear
stress parallel to the weld.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.34375in,height=\textheight]{images/CH13 PNGs/example 13.2 part 1.png}
\end{center}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

First determine the inner radius of the vessel. Wall thickness 𝑡 = 40 𝑚𝑚
= 0.04 𝑚.

Outer radius, \emph{r\textsubscript{o}} = 1.5/2 = 0.75 𝑚

Inner radius, \emph{r\textsubscript{i}} = 0.75 - 0.04 = 0.71 𝑚

Now calculate the axial and hoop stresses.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_A=\frac{P r_i}{2 t}=\frac{5 * 0.71}{2 * 0.04}=44.4 \mathrm{MPa} \\
& \sigma_H=\frac{P r_i}{t}=\frac{5 * 0.71}{0.04}=88.8 \mathrm{MPa}
\end{aligned}
\]

By the methods of section 12.1, we can calculate the normal stress
perpendicular to the weld. Draw a stress element of a point on the
pressure vessel. The axial stress will act horizontally and the hoop
stress vertically for this element.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.26042in,height=\textheight]{images/CH13 PNGs/example 13.2 part 2.png}
\end{center}

The weld is at an angle of 25° measured counter-clockwise from
horizontal. The normal stress perpendicular to this weld is therefore at
an angle of 65° clockwise from horizontal. We can determine the normal
stress at this orientation from:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_x^{\prime}=\frac{\sigma_x+\sigma_y}{2}+\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2} \cos (2 \theta)+\tau_{x y} \sin (2 \theta) \\
\sigma_x^{\prime}=\frac{44.4+88.8}{2}+\frac{44.4-88.8}{2} \cos \left(2 *-65^{\circ}\right)+0 \\
\sigma_x^{\prime}=66.6-22.2 \cos \left(-130^{\circ}\right) \\
\sigma_x^{\prime}=80.9 \mathrm{MPa}
\end{gathered}
\]

The shear stress occurs parallel to the weld at an angle of 25°
counter-clockwise from the horizontal. We can determine the shear stress
at this orientation from:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\tau_{x^{\prime} y^{\prime}}=-\left(\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2}\right) \sin (2 \theta)+\tau_{x y} \cos (2 \theta) \\
\tau_{x^{\prime} y^{\prime}}=-\left(\frac{44.4-88.8}{2}\right) \sin \left(2 * 25^{\circ}\right)+0 \\
\tau_{x^{\prime} y^{\prime}}=-\left(\frac{44.4-88.8}{2}\right) \sin \left(2 * 25^{\circ}\right)+0 \\
\tau_{x^{\prime} y^{\prime}}=22.2 \sin \left(50^{\circ}\right) \\
\tau_{x^{\prime} y^{\prime}}=17.0 \mathrm{MPa}
\end{gathered}
\]

\section{Spherical Pressure Vessels}\label{spherical-pressure-vessels}

Click to expand

A spherical vessel will yield the same cross-section regardless of the
axis it is cut along (figure 13.7). The stress in the walls of a
spherical vessel is the same as the axial stress in a cylindrical
vessel.

By equilibrium:

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sum F_x=0 \\
\left(\sigma_A\right)\left(2 \pi r_i t\right)-(P)\left(\pi r_i^2\right)=0 \\
\sigma_A=\frac{P r_i}{2 t}
\end{gathered}
\]

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=2.85417in,height=\textheight]{images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.7.png}

}

\caption{Figure 13.7: Cross-section through the spherical vessel showing
the axial stress in the walls (𝜎\textsubscript{A}) and the fluid
pressure P.}

\end{figure}%

In this case, the same stress exists in both principal directions. We
will again assume that the radial stress is zero, meaning that these
stresses again form a state of plane stress (figure 13.8). There is
again no shear stress, so these stresses are the principal stresses. In
this case, the two principal stresses are the same.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=2.5625in,height=\textheight]{images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.8.png}

}

\caption{Figure 13.8: Spherical vessels experience the same axial stress
in both principal directions. There is no shear stress.}

\end{figure}%

Note that these principal stresses are equal to 𝜎\textsubscript{2} in
the cylindrical vessel. As such, spherical vessels are stronger than
cylindrical vessels. However, they are also more expensive to
manufacture so cylindrical vessels are still very common.

We may again use the methods of chapter 12 to perform stress
transformation. Figure 13.9 shows Mohr's Circle for the in-plane and
out-of-plane stresses.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4.35417in,height=\textheight]{images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.9.png}

}

\caption{Figure 13.9: Mohr's Circle for the stresses in the walls of a
spherical thin-walled pressure vessel. Principal stresses
𝜎\textsubscript{1} = 𝜎\textsubscript{2} and the in-plane circle reduces
to a single point. The 3rd principal stress 𝜎\textsubscript{3} = 0.}

\end{figure}%

This time 𝜎\textsubscript{1} = 𝜎\textsubscript{2} and so the in-plane
Mohr's Circle reduces to a single point. The maximum in-plane shear
stress is therefore zero. The maximum out-of-plane shear stress can be
calculated from:

\[
\tau_{\max a b s}=\frac{\sigma_1}{2}
\]

Example 13.3 demonstrates the design of a spherical vessel, based on the
allowable stress in the vessel walls.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 13.3: Needs title}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

A spherical pressure vessel is made of steel with a yield strength of
250 MPa. The vessel has an outer diameter of 4 meters and a wall
thickness of 25 mm. If the factor of safety with respect to yield is
2.5, determine the maximum allowable gage pressure of the fluid within
the vessel.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Wall thickness, 𝑡 = 25 𝑚𝑚 = 0.025 𝑚

Outer radius, \emph{r\textsubscript{o}} = 2 𝑚

Inner radius, \emph{r\textsubscript{i}} = 2 - 0.025 = 1.975 𝑚

Start by using the factor of safety to find the maximum allowable stress
in the walls of the vessel.

\[
\sigma_{\text {allow }}=\frac{250}{2.5}=100 \text{ Mpa}
\]

Spherical vessels experience the same stress in both directions:

\[
\sigma_A=\frac{P r_i}{2 t}
\]

Rearrange this equation to solve for P:

\[
\begin{gathered}
P=\frac{\sigma_A * 2 t}{r_i} \\
P=\frac{100 * 2 * 0.025}{1.975}=2.53 \text{ MPa}
\end{gathered}

Pressure vessels contain fluids at high pressure. A thin walled pressure
vessel is one where
\(\frac{\text { Inner radius }}{\text { Wall thickness }}>10\).

For thin walled pressure vessels, the stresses in the vessel walls are
assumed to be constant across the thickness of the wall and the stress
in the radial direction is assumed to be zero. The stresses created in
the axial and hoop directions by the fluid pressure are the principal
stresses.

Pressure vessels are commonly cylindrical or spherical. Cylindrical
vessels experience both axial and hoop stresses. The axial stress is
half of the hoop stress. Spherical vessels experience only an axial
stress. As such, spherical vessels experience less stress than
cylindrical vessels.

There is no shear stress generated in the axial and hoop directions.
However, stress transformation can be used to determine both in-plane
and out-of-plane shear stresses.

In this chapter, we will use of all of the previously discussed methods
to determine normal and shear stress resulting from axial forces
(chapter 5), bending moments (chapter 9), pressure (chapter 13),
transverse loads (chapter 10), and torsion (chapter 6) to determine an
overall general stress state for any given point on a structure.

In section 14.1, the various sources of normal stress are reviewed and
expanded on. They will be reframed in terms of general axes so as to
clarify which other stresses they may combine with. In section 14.1.1 we
will revisit bending stress to express the unsymmetric bending stress
equation in terms of general cross-sectional axes (recall in chapter 9,
the cross-sectional axes were always y and z). In section 14.1.2,
eccentric loading, which is a specific instance of combined normal
stress in which normal forces result in bending, will be considered.

In section 14.2, we will focus on combining the various sources of shear
stress to determine the total shear stress. To expand on the concepts
discussed and used in Chapters 6 and 10, we will perform calculations
based on both possible transverse loading directions as well as torsion.
As in section 14.1, this will be done with a general set of coordinate
axes.

In section 14.3, we will further expand the above cases to situations in
which all combinations of loading are possible and the general stress
state is determined.

Note that the determination of the internal reactions for the general
problems presented in this chapter will require the use of 3D
equilibrium equations, particularly for determining bending moments and
torsion. You may find it helpful to review section 1.4 to understand
these calculations.

\section{Combined Normal Stress}\label{combined-normal-stress}

Click to expand

All forms of normal stress previously discussed act in the longitudinal
(also referred to as axial) direction except for the hoop stress from
pressure. The longitudinal direction is the direction normal to the
cross-sectional location of the point for which stress is being
evaluated.

To be able to discuss directions and stress components in general terms,
we will consider the loadings and stresses in terms of the longitudinal
direction (L) at the point in the structure being considered, the
centroidal vertical axis of the cross-section (V), and the centroidal
horizontal axis of the cross-section (H). The specific axes that these
terms refer to depends on how the axes are specified generally for a
structure as well as the location of the point in question.

For example, consider the structure in figure 141 with the x, y, z axes
oriented at the origin as shown. For point P on the structure, the
longitudinal axis is the x-axis and the vertical and horizontal axes of
the cross-section are the y-axis and z-axis, respectively. On the other
hand, for point Q, the longitudinal axis is the y-axis and the vertical
and horizontal axes of the cross-section are the z-axis and x-axis,
respectively.

\textbf{Figure 14.1:} The longitudinal (L), horizontal (H), and vertical
(V) axes depend on how the axes are arranged globally for the structure
as well as the specific location of the point in question.

We have seen that axial load, bending moments, and pressure all result
in normal stresses. We can express the 2D normal stress state for any
given point as:

\[
\sigma_L=\frac{\sum F_L}{A}+\sigma_{\text {bending }}+\frac{p r}{2 t}
\]

in the longitudinal direction and:

\[
\sigma_{\text {hoop }}=\frac{p r}{t}
\]

in the direction of the other planar axis of the point in question. For
the example given in figure 14.1, both points are in the x-y plane, but
the hoop direction is the y direction for point P and the x direction
for point Q.

In the above stress equation, FL is the total force in the direction
normal to the cross-section (same direction as the longitudinal
direction). It is positive if the total normal force is tensile and
negative if compressive. In addition, A is the cross-sectional area, p
is the internal pressure, r is the inside radius of a pipe, and t is the
wall thickness of a pipe. The pressure term will always be positive for
internal pressure. Of course, for a solid cross-section, or a hollow
cross-section with no pressure, the hoop stress and the last term of the
longitudinal stress would be 0.

To help break down this analysis, section 14.1.1 presents further
clarification on finding bending stress for general coordinate axes.
Section 14.1.2 discusses the specific combined loading case of an axial
force that also results in bending.

\subsection{Generalized Bending Stress
Equation}\label{generalized-bending-stress-equation}

In chapter 9, an equation for bending stress based on having bending
around the cross-sectional axes of y and z was derived. That equation
is:

\[
\sigma_x=-\frac{M_z y}{I_z}+\frac{M_y z}{I_y}
\]

The minus in front of the Mz expression and the plus in front of the My
expression are specifically related to the y and z cross-sectional axes
as oriented as they were in chapter 9, with the z-axis positive
horizontally to the left and the y axis positive vertically upwards.
However, because cross-sectional axes for any given point on a structure
can vary based on both how the global axes are specified and on the
location of the point within the structure, we will need to know how to
apply the bending stress equation for a general set of axes before we
can combine this stress with other sources of normal stress.

In any given loading situation, the bending moments are the moments
around the cross-sectional centroidal axes. If the cross-sectional
centroidal axes are thought of generally as the vertical axis (V) and
the horizontal axis (H) as shown in figure 14.2, the resulting stress
would be in the longitudinal direction (L), and we can express the
unsymmetric bending stress equation as:

\[
\sigma_L(\text { bending })= \pm\left|\frac{M_V d_H}{I_V}\right| \pm\left|\frac{M_H d_V}{I_H}\right|
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  𝜎\textsubscript{𝐿} = Bending stress in the longitudinal direction
  {[}Pa, psi{]}
\item
  M\textsubscript{V}= Bending moment around the vertical axis {[}N⸱m,
  lb⸱in{]}
\item
  M\textsubscript{H}= Bending moment around the horizontal axis {[}N⸱m,
  lb⸱in{]}
\item
  d\textsubscript{H} = horizontal distance between the point on the
  cross-section for which the stress is being calculated and the V axis
  {[}m, in{]}
\item
  d\textsubscript{V} = the vertical distance between the point on the
  cross-section for which the stress is being calculated and the H axis
  {[}m, in{]}
\item
  I\textsubscript{V} = the moment of inertia about the vertical axis
  {[}m\textsuperscript{4}, in\textsuperscript{4}{]}
\item
  I\textsubscript{H} = is the moment of inertia about the horizontal
  axis {[}m\textsuperscript{4}, in\textsuperscript{4}{]}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Figure 14.2:} General coordinate axes and the distances used in
the bending stress equation

The sign on each individual term needs to be determined by inspection of
the bending direction. The side of the cross section that would be on
the ``inside'' of the bend will be in compression and vice versa. Figure
143 illustrates the sense of the bending moment around the horizontal
axis that would result in compression above the H axis and tension
below. Figure 14-4 illustrates the sense of bending moment around the
vertical axis that would result in tension to the left of the V axis and
compression to the right. The bending moment is shown for a section
above and below a cut on a vertical structure and to the left and right
of a cut on a horizontally oriented structure. The opposite directions
of bending moment would lead to the opposite signs of stress.

\textbf{Figure 14.3:} Sense of bending moment around the horizontal (H)
axis that would result in tension below the H axis and compression above

\textbf{Figure 14.4:} Sense of bending moment around the vertical (V)
axis that results in tension to the left of the V axis and compression
to the right

If visualization is difficult, one can use the following tool:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Draw the \textbf{applied} moment arrows around the V and H axes on the
  cross-section in the correct sense. Make sure to draw them such that
  they go over (or in front of) the bending axis (as opposed to under or
  behind)
\item
  The side (top/bottom for moments around the H axis and left/right for
  the moments around the V axis) the arrows point into are the
  compressive sides and the sides the tails of the arrows are on are the
  tensile sides.
\end{enumerate}

The use of this tool will be demonstrated for the bending stress
calculation in example 14.1.

It will also be helpful to note that the bending stress for a point that
lies directly on a centroidal axis will be zero for bending around that
axis since the bending axis is the neutral axis for that direction of
bending.

\textbf{Figure 14.5:} Points that lie on a centroidal axis will have no
bending stress from bending moments around that axis

found to be M\textsubscript{x} = 376 kN mm and M\textsubscript{z} = 204
kN mm as shown. Determine the bending stress at points P and Q.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Drawing the cross-section, we can see that the vertical axis of the
cross section is the z-axis and the horizontal axis of the cross section
is the x-axis. The resulting stress is in the longitudinal direction,
which is the y-axis. The bending stress equation can then be expressed
as:

\[
\sigma_y= \pm\left|\frac{M_z x}{I_z}\right| \pm\left|\frac{M_x z}{I_x}\right|
\]

The magnitudes of the bending moments are given. With the circular
cross-section, the moment of inertia of both cross-sectional axes are:

\[
\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{x}}=\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{x}}=\frac{\pi}{4} r^4=\frac{\pi}{4}(16 \mathrm{~mm})^4=51.47 \times 10^3-\mathrm{mm}^4=51.47 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}^4
\]

For point P, because it is on the centroidal z-axis, we know that it
experiences no stress from Mz. Given the clockwise bending moment around
the x-axis, the beam can be visualized as bending in a manner such that
point P will be on the ``inside'' of the bend, or in compression.

If the visualization is difficult, we can also use the ``tool''
described in section 14.1. Noting that the applied moment in this case
is in the same direction as the bending moment (since equilibrium
dictates that the moment at the fixed support is opposite of what is
applied and the bending moment is opposite of the fixed support, we can
conclude that the bending moment and applied moment would be in the same
direction), we can draw the moment arrow across the cross-section. Note
that this arrow should be drawn going over the x-axis. Drawing the arrow
on the cross-section in this way, we can see that the arrowhead would
point towards P, so all points above the x-axis, including P, are in
compression from this moment.

{[}figure{]}

The z distance from the x-axis to be P is the radius. We can then
calculate the normal stress at point P to be:

\[
\sigma_{y P}=-\left|\frac{M_x z}{I_x}\right|=-\frac{376 \mathrm{~N} \cdot m(0.016 \mathrm{~m})}{51.47 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}^4}=-117 \mathrm{MPa}
\]

Similarly, point Q will experience no stress from M\textsubscript{x}
since it is on the x-axis, but it will feel stress from
M\textsubscript{z}. The x distance from the z-axis to point Q is also
the radius. The sign on the stress can be determined by visualizing the
bending to be as shown in the front view below and noting that point Q
would be on the outside part of the bend. Alternatively, drawing the
moment arrow on the cross-section as was done for point P above reveals
that point Q is on the tail side of the arrow, so in tension.

{[}figure{]}

The normal stress at point Q is thus calculated to be:

\[
\sigma_{y Q}=+\left|\frac{M_z x}{I_z}\right|=\frac{204 \mathrm{~N} \cdot m(0.016 \mathrm{~mm})}{51.47 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}^4}=63.4 \mathrm{MPa}
\]

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{yP} = 116.9 MPa (compression)}

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{yQ} = 63.4 MPa (tension)}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Eccentric Loading}\label{eccentric-loading}

When the line of action of an axial load does not pass through the
centroid of a cross section, it will result in both a normal reaction
force and a bending moment. For example, consider the traffic light and
corresponding free body diagram shown in figure 14.6.

\textbf{Figure 14.6:} The vertical pole is subject to direct axial
stress and bending stress

The vertical support pole is subjected to normal forces from the weights
of the traffic lights (the weight of the horizontal poles, cameras,
etc., are assumed to be negligible for this example) as well as to
bending moments around both cross-sectional axes (x and z) that result
from the fact that the weights are not directly centered on the
centroidal axes of the support pole. The total normal stress in the
longitudinal direction, σ\textsubscript{y}, at any given point on the
pole would be given by the stress from the total normal force
(\(\frac{\sum F_y}{A}\)) plus the bending stress from the bending moment
around the z axis that results from W\textsubscript{1} and
W\textsubscript{2} and the bending moment around the x axis that results
from W\textsubscript{3}.

In terms of the general axes discussed in section 14.1.1, we have:

\[
\sigma_L= \pm\left|\frac{F_L}{A}\right| \pm\left|\frac{M_V d_H}{I_V}\right| \pm\left|\frac{M_H d_V}{I_H}\right|
\]

The sign for the first term is positive if the total force is tensile
(directed away from the cross-section) and negative if the total force
is compressive (pointed towards the cross-section).

Examples 14.2 and 14.3 demonstrate the calculation of normal stress in
eccentric loading problems.

Example 14.4 goes through the process of calculating each of the
components of normal stress and then combining them to determine the
normal stress state at particular point.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 14.2:}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The structure is subjected to vertical forces as shown. Determine the
total normal stress at points P and Q on the cross-section of the
vertical portion of the structure.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

The generalized normal stress equation is:

\[
\sigma_L= \pm\left|\frac{F_L}{A}\right| \pm\left|\frac{M_V d_H}{I_V}\right| \pm\left|\frac{M_H d_V}{I_H}\right|
\]

In this case, the longitudinal axis (L) is the y-axis. The vertical axis
of the cross-section (V) is the z-axis and the horizontal axis (H) is
the x-axis.

To apply the equation, the internal reactions N, Mx, and Mz are needed.
Since the internal reactions remain constant along the vertical portion
of the structure, we can cut anywhere along its length to determine
these internal reactions. The reaction moment around the x axis, Mx, can
be determined to be 0 by inspection since all the forces pass through
the centroidal x-axis of the cross-section. When finding the bending
moments, it is important to remember that the moments needed are the
moments around the centroidal axes of the cross-section.

{[}figure{]}

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sum F_y=N-75 l b s-50 l b s=0 \text {, so } N=125 \mathrm{lbs} \\
\sum M_z=75 \mathrm{lbs}(15 \mathrm{in})-50 \mathrm{lbs}(25 \mathrm{in})+M z=0 \text {, so } M z=125 \mathrm{lb} \mathrm{in}
\end{gathered}
\]

Since both N and Mz are positive, the respective directions drawn on the
FBD are confirmed to be correct. Thus, the normal force is compressive
(pointed towards the cut section) and the bending moment is
counterclockwise around the z axis.

The total normal stress at point P can then be calculated with the
following inputs:

FL = N = 125 lbs

A = (6in)(8in) = 48 in2

MV = Mx = 125 lb in

dx = x distance between point P and the z axis = 2 in

Iz = (1/12)*(6in)*(8in3) = 256 in4

The normal force N is compressive, so that term in the stress equation
is made negative. With the counter-clockwise bending moment on the upper
section, one can visualize that the bending would take on a ``C'' shape
with point P on the outside of the bend, so point P would be in tension
from the bending moment and that term in the equation is made positive.

As mentioned in section 14.1.1, another way to determine the sign on the
bending stress is to draw the direction of the overall applied moment on
the cross-section. In this case, the total applied moment around the
z-axis is:

\[
M=75 l b s(15 i n)-50 l b s(25 i n)=-125 \mathrm{lb} \text { in, or } 125 \mathrm{lb} \text { in clockwise }
\]

Drawing the clockwise moment on the cross-section we see that the left
side of the cross-section is on the tail side of the arrow, so we can
conclude that all points to the left of the centroidal z-axis will be in
tension. Note that for this tool to work, the arrow must always be drawn
to be going ``over'' the axis as opposed to under.

{[}figure{]}

\[
\sigma_{y P}=-\left|\frac{125 l b}{48 i n^2}\right|+\left|\frac{(125 l b i n)(2 i n)}{256 i n^4}\right| \\
\sigma_{y P}=-1.63 p s i
\]

The negative answer indicates that the stress is compressive.

To calculate the stress at point Q, all inputs to the equation remain
the same except for dx. The x distance between the centroidal z-axis and
point Q is 4 in. In addition, the sign on the bending stress is negative
instead of positive since point K is on the inside of the bend (or on
the arrow side of the cross-section drawn with the applied moment).
Thus,

\[
\sigma_{y Q}=-\left|\frac{125 l b}{48 i n^2}\right|-\left|\frac{(125 l b i n)(4 i n)}{256 i i^4}\right| \\
\sigma_{y Q}=-4.56 p s i
\]

\textbf{σyP = -3.49 psi, σyQ = -6.42 psi}

A force pulls up on point P on the post with rectangular cross section
as shown. Determine the normal stress at point A.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

In this problem, there are three sources of normal stress: the bending
stress from bending around the y axis, the bending stress from bending
around the x axis, and the axial stress from the 180 kN force acting
normal to the cross-section.

For the given loading, the internal reactions will be the same for any z
location, so we can make a cut anywhere to determine the bending moment
and normal force reaction

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Sigma M_X=180 \mathrm{kN}(50 \mathrm{~mm})+M_x=0 \\
M_X=-9000 \mathrm{kN} \mathrm{mm} \\
\Sigma M_Z=\quad 180 \mathrm{kN}(40 \mathrm{~mm})+M_z=0 \\
M_Z=-7200 \mathrm{kH} \cdot \mathrm{mm} \\
\varepsilon F_Y=180 \mathrm{kN}-N=0 \\
N=180 \mathrm{kN}
\end{aligned}
\]

{[}figure{]}

By inspection of the applied moments, we can visualize that the bending
around the x-axis is such that the post would bend towards us and points
along the back edge where point A is would be in tension.

We can also visualize that the bending around the z-axis is such that
the post would bend in a backwards C shape and points to the left of the
centroidal z-axis would be in compression. We can also observe the the
normal force reaction is tensile.

Applying the generalized normal stress equation (with the pressure term
omitted):

\[
\sigma_{L A}= \pm\left|\frac{F_L}{A}\right| \pm\left|\frac{M_V d_H}{I_V}\right| \pm\left|\frac{M_H d_V}{I_H}\right|
\]

In this case, the longitudinal axis of the post is the y-axis, the
vertical axis of the cross-section is the y-axis, and the horizontal
axis of the cross-section is x-axis. The dH in the equation is the x
distance between centroidal z-axis and point A. The dV in the equation
is the z distance between the centroidal x-axis and point A.

\[
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_{y A}=\left|\frac{N}{A}\right|-\left|\frac{M_z d_x}{I_z}\right|+\left|\frac{M_x d_z}{I_x}\right| \\
\left.\sigma_{y A}=\left|\frac{180,000 N}{(0.2 m)(0.15 m)}\right| \frac{\mid 7200 N \cdot m(0.085 m)}{\frac{1}{12}(0.15 m)(0.2 m)^3}|+| \frac{9000 N \cdot m(0.075 m)}{\frac{1}{12}(0.2 m)(0.15 m)^3} \right\rvert\, \\
\sigma_{y A}=11.9 M P a
\end{gathered}
\]

The stress works out to be positive and therefore tensile.

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{yA} =11.9 MPa}

For the pressurized pipe loaded as shown, determine the normal stresses
at point H. Noting that there would be no shear stress at point H for
this loading, represent the general stress state of point H on a stress
element. The pipe has an outside diameter of 200 mm and a wall thickness
of 10 mm. The load Pz = 18 kN and the internal pressure in the pipe is
1500 kPa.

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Consider the general normal stress equation:

\[
\sigma_L= \pm\left|\frac{F_L}{A}\right| \pm\left|\frac{M_V d_H}{I_V}\right| \pm\left|\frac{M_H d_V}{I_H}\right| \pm \frac{p r}{2 t}
\]

In this problem, the longitudinal direction is the z direction and the
horizontal and vertical axes of the cross-section where H is located are
the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. Since there is pressure loading in
this problem, there is also normal stress in the hoop direction (x and
y-directions).

So we have:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_{\text {long }} & = \pm\left|\frac{F_z}{A}\right| \pm\left|\frac{\left|M_y d_x\right|}{I_y}\right| \pm\left|\frac{\mid M_x d_y}{I_x}\right| \pm \frac{p r}{2 t} \\
\sigma_{\text {hoop }} & =\frac{p r}{t}
\end{aligned}
\]

Cutting through the part of the pipe where point H is located and
applying equilibrium provides the following results for the internal
reactions:

{[}figure{]}

\[
\begin{gathered}
\varepsilon F_y=N-18 \mathrm{kN}=0 \\
N=18 \mathrm{kN} \\
\varepsilon M_y=(18 \mathrm{kN})(1.8 \mathrm{~m})+M_y=0 \\
M_y=-32.4 \mathrm{kN} \cdot \mathrm{m}
\end{gathered}
\]

Note that force is only applied in the z direction so no other force
reactions were drawn. There is also no force that results in a moment
around the x-axis or z-axis, so Mx and Mz were also omitted from the
FBD.

The normal force is positive based on the drawn direction, so it is
compressive. The bending moment around the y-axis was drawn
counterclockwise around the y axis, but the result is negative, so the
bending moment is actually clockwise. However, since point H lies on the
y-axis, there will be no stress at point H from this bending moment.~

Thus the longitudinal stress (z-direction) becomes:

\[
\sigma_{\text {long }}=-\left|\frac{F_L}{A}\right|+\frac{p r}{2 t}=-\frac{18,000}{\pi\left(0.1^2-0.09^2\right)}+\frac{(1,500,000)(0.1)}{2(0.01)}=4.48 \mathrm{MPa}
\]

The hoop stress (x-direction) is:

\[
\sigma_{\text {hoop }}=\frac{p r}{t}=\frac{(1,500,000)(0.1)}{0.01}=15 M P a
\]

Now we can sketch a stress element at point H in the x-z plane.

\section{General Shear Stress}\label{general-shear-stress}

Click to expand

Shear stress due to torsion was discussed in chapter 6 while shear
stress due to transverse loading was discussed in chapter 10. In this
section, the considerations that go into determining the total shear
stress that arise when both forms of loading will be discussed.

\subsection{Shear Stress due to
Torsion}\label{shear-stress-due-to-torsion}

As discussed in section 6.1, shear stress due to torsion can be
calculated as:

\[
\tau(\text { torsional })=\frac{T c}{J}
\]

Where T is the internal torque at the location of interest, c is the
outer radius of a circular shaft, and J is the polar moment of inertia
of a solid or hollow circular shaft.

For general problems, one may need to calculate T, so it is important to
remember that torque is the moment about the longitudinal axis of a
body, or that component of the moment that causes the body to twist.
Since this form of shear stress will be combined with transverse shear
stress to get the total, understanding the sign on the shear stress will
be important.

Recall that when a stress element is drawn, a positive shear stress is
one for which the shear stress arrow goes in the positive vertical
direction on a positive vertical face and in the positive horizontal
direction on a positive horizontal face. The positive or negative
directions and faces are established by the positive sense of the axes
which define the plane the point is in.

To determine which way a shear stress arrow would be drawn for a given
stress element, one must cut the body at one edge of the stress element
and visualize the direction in which the load would be applied across
the cut.

For example, in figure 14.7, when the cylinder is cut at the top of the
stress element, we examine the bottom section of the cylinder and note
that the reaction torque at the cut surface goes in the opposite
direction to that which is applied at the bottom surface. This results
in a counterclockwise reaction torque at the cut which means that the
top section tends to want to twist (and exert a force) from left to
right across the top element edge. If the vertical axis is positive
upwards, the top face is a positive face. In addition, if the horizontal
axis is positive to the right, the rightwards shear force arrow is in
the positive direction. Together this means that the shear stress can be
concluded to be positive since we would have a positive shear force on a
positive face.

Similarly, when the cut is made at the bottom edge of the element, we
can examine the top section of the cylinder for which equilibrium
dictates that there is a clockwise reaction moment at the cut edge. This
means that the bottom section tends to want twist from right to left
across the bottom element edge. If the vertical axis is positive upwards
so that the top face is a positive face, and the horizontal axis is
positive to the right, the leftwards shear force would be a negative
force acting on a negative face, so the shear stress would still be
concluded to be positive.

\textbf{Figure 14.7:} Signs for shear stress

\subsection{Shear Stress due to Transverse
Shear}\label{shear-stress-due-to-transverse-shear}

In chapter 10, the equation \(\tau=\frac{V Q}{I t}\) was evaluated to
find the shear stress due to transverse shear force V. In that chapter,
only one direction of shear force was considered for each problem and
the sign on shear stress was not considered. For general loading, we may
have two directions of transverse shear force corresponding to the two
cross-sectional axes directions, as shown in figure 14.8, so we will
need to apply the transverse shear stress equation for both directions
and also understand the signs so that we can combine them with each
other and with the torsional shear stress.

Figure 14.8: Shear forces in two directions on cross-section

When applying the transverse shear stress equations for specific
directions of shear force, it is helpful to keep the following in mind:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The cut one makes to determine the first moment of area Q will be
  perpendicular to the direction of shear force.
\item
  The area moment of inertia will be the moment of inertia around the
  axis perpendicular to the shear force.
\item
  The thickness, as before, refers to the thickness of the solid part of
  the cross section that one cuts through to calculate Q.
\end{enumerate}

Using the same reference axes as with the general normal stress equation
(H for horizontal centroidal axis and V for vertical centroidal axis),
the transverse shear stress equation can be written as follows:

\[
\tau(\text { transverse })= \pm\left|\frac{V_H Q_V}{I_V t_V}\right| \pm\left|\frac{V_V Q_H}{I_H t_H}\right|
\]

The subscript on Q and t refers to the direction of the cut through the
cross-section.

The signs on the shear stress are determined similarly to the manner
described in section 14.2.1 for torsion. The direction of the internal
shear force is determined by equilibrium and this direction relative to
the positive axes and faces on the stress element are used to establish
direction.

It will be helpful to note that for any point on a cross-section that is
on an edge that a transverse shear force goes through (or for a circular
cross-section, any point on the outer diameter that lies in the path of
the force), the transverse shear stress due to that direction of shear
force is 0. This is illustrated in figure 14.9. This is because the
specified points would be on free surfaces in these cases. For example,
for a vertical shear force, the bending would be around the horizontal
axis, so the top and bottom surfaces would be considered free surfaces
with no shear force acting above the top surface or below the bottom
surface. The same would hold true for the left and right surfaces in the
case of a horizontal shear forces that would result in bending around
the vertical axis.

Figure 14.9: Locations of zero transverse shear stress

Examples 14.5 and 14.6 demonstrate the calculation of transverse shear
stress with multiple directions of shear force.

location on the post, we must first cut the post at that vertical
location and find the internal reactions by applying equilibrium. The
illustration below shows the section below the cut made at the
cross-section where points P and Q are located. The reactions at the
support due to the applied loading must be in the opposite direction to
the loading for equilibrium and the internal reactions at the cut
section will be opposite to the support reactions. Note that there are
also bending moments around the x and y axes due to the applied forces,
but those result in normal stress, not shear stress.

{[}figure{]}

Given that there is no torsion in this problem, the general shear stress
equation can be written:

\[
\tau= \pm\left|\frac{V_H Q_V}{I_V t_V}\right| \pm\left|\frac{V_V Q_H}{I_H t_H}\right|
\]

Where the horizontal axis of the cross-section is the y--axis and the
vertical axis of the cross section is the x-axis.

For any point on the cross-section, we can substitute:

V\textsubscript{H} = V\textsubscript{y} = 78 kN

V\textsubscript{V} = V\textsubscript{x} = 94 kN

I\textsubscript{H} =
\(\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{y}}=\frac{1}{12}(160 \mathrm{~mm})^3(120 \mathrm{~mm})=40.96 \times 10^6-\mathrm{mm}^4=40.96 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^4\)

I\textsubscript{V} =
\(\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{x}}=\frac{1}{12}(120 \mathrm{~mm})^3(160 \mathrm{~mm})=23.04 \times \underline{1} \underline{\underline{6}} \mathrm{~mm}^4=23.04 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^4\)

The Q and the t terms will depend on the specific points on the
cross-section.

\textbf{Point P:}

The x faces of the post (front and back sides) do not feel shear stress
from V\textsubscript{x} since V\textsubscript{x} results in bending
around the y-axis and the front and back sides would be free surfaces
for such bending. In the shear stress equation, we can also see this
from that fact that Q\textsubscript{y} = A'x' would be zero for point P
(A' = 0 below the horizontal cut at H and x' = 0 for the area above the
cut).

To find the shear stress from V\textsubscript{y}, we would make a
vertical cut through point H and calculate

\[
\mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{x}}=\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{y}^{\prime}=\frac{1}{2}(160 \mathrm{~mm})(120 \mathrm{~mm})\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(160 \mathrm{~mm})=384000 \mathrm{~mm}^3=384 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^3
\]

t\textsubscript{x} = 120 mm = 0.12 m

{[}figure{]}

Looking at the FBD of the cut section of the post drawn above, we can
see that V\textsubscript{y} goes across the top of the stress element of
P in the positive y direction. The top of the element is on the positive
z-face, so we a positive force on a positive face, which makes the
resulting shear stress positive.

{[}figure{]}

So

\[
\tau_P=\frac{V_y Q_x}{I_x t_x}=\frac{(78000 \mathrm{~N})\left(384 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^3\right)}{\left(40.96 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^4\right)(0.12 \mathrm{~m})}=6.09 \mathrm{MPa}
\]

\ul{Point S:}

For point S, the shear stress from Vy will be zero by the same reasoning
as used for point P and Vx (Qx = 0 for point S), so we only need to
calculate the shear stress from Vx.

To find the shear stress from Vx, we would make a horizontal cut through
point S and calculate

\[
Q y=A^{\prime} x^{\prime}=(160 \mathrm{~mm})(30 \mathrm{~mm})(60 \mathrm{~mm}-15 \mathrm{~mm})=216000 \mathrm{~mm}^3=216 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^3
\]

t\textsubscript{y} = 160 mm = 0.16 m

{[}figure{]}

Again looking at the FBD of the cut post above, we can see that Vx goes
across the top of the stress element for S in the negative x direction.
So we a negative force on a positive face, which makes the resulting
shear stress negative

{[}figure{]}

So

\[
\tau_S=-\frac{V_x Q_y}{I_y t_y}=-\frac{(94000 \mathrm{~N})\left(216 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^3\right)}{\left(23.04 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^4\right)(0.16 \mathrm{~m})}=-5.51 \mathrm{MPa}
\]

\textbf{τ\textsubscript{P} = 6.09 MPa, τ\textsubscript{S} = -5.51 MPa}

First we need to find the internal reactions at the location of the
points in question. To find the internal reactions, we will first draw
the whole body FBD and apply equilibrium to find the reactions at the
support. Then we will cut the body at the location of points J,K and
apply equilibrium to the cut section to find the internal reactions. All
the reactions are calculated below even though we only need Vx, Vz, and
My to find the shear stresses.

{[}figure{]}

To find reactions at support:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sum F_x=R x+1500 \mathrm{lb}=0 \\
& \mathrm{Rx}=-1500 \mathrm{lb} \\
& \sum F_y=R y+0=0 \\
& \mathrm{Ry}=0 \\
& \sum F_z=R z+900 l b=0 \\
& \mathrm{Rz}=-900 \mathrm{lb}

\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sum M_x=M_{R x}+(900 \mathrm{lb})(80 \mathrm{lb} \mathrm{in})=0 \\
& \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{Rx}}=-72000 \mathrm{lb} \text { in } \\
& \sum M_y=M_{R y}+900 \mathrm{lb}(18 \mathrm{in})=0 \\

& \mathrm{Mz}=1.2 \times 10^6 \mathrm{lb} \text { in }

\]

To find reactions at cut section:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sum F_x=R x+V x=-1500 l b+V x=0 \\
& V x=1500 \mathrm{lb} \\
& \sum F_y=R y+V y=0+V y=0 \\

& M z=-1.185 \times 10^6 \mathrm{lb} \text { in }
\end{aligned}
\]

The longitudinal direction based on the part of the rod on the y-axis is
the y-axis, so the torsional moment is My. Both points J and K will
experience the same magnitude of shear stress from the torsion, however,
it is possible for the signs to be different for the two different
points depending on orientation. The magnitude of the shear stress is:

\[
\left.\tau_{\text {torsion }}= \pm\left|\frac{T c}{J}\right|= \pm\left|\frac{M_y(c)}{J}\right|= \pm \frac{16200 \mathrm{lb} \mathrm{in} \mathrm{(3.35in)}}{\frac{\pi}{32}(6.7 \mathrm{in})^4} \right\rvert\,= \pm 274.3
\]

Considering the stress element for each point with the counterclockwise
torque resulting in a downwards directed force across the cut face of
the element, we can note that there would be a negative z force on a
positive y face for point K and a positive x force on a positive y face
for point J. So

τ\textsubscript{K}(torsion) = - 274.3 psi and τJ(torsion) = + 274.3 psi

{[}figure{]}

Now turning our attention to the shear stresses from the transverse
forces, we note the cross sectional axes are the x and z axes, so the
transverse shear forces are those that are in the x and z directions. We
can also note that with K being on the x axis of the cross section, it
will not experience transverse shear stress from V\textsubscript{x}.
Similarly, point J will not experience transverse shears tress from
V\textsubscript{y}. In addition, since the cross-section is circular, we
know that for both points:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Q}_{\text {max }}=\frac{1}{12} d^3=\frac{1}{12}(6.7 i n)^3=25.06 \operatorname{in}^3 \\
& t=d=6.7 \text { in }^3 \\
& \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{x}}=\mathrm{Iz}=\frac{\pi}{64} d^4=\frac{\pi}{64}(6.7 \mathrm{in})^4=98.92 i n^4 \\
&
\end{aligned}
\]

Since V\textsubscript{z} acts in the positive z direction on the
positive y face for point K, the transverse shear stress for point K is
positive. Since V\textsubscript{x} acts in the positive x direction on
the y face for point Y, the transverse shear stress for point J is also
positive.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \tau_K(\text { transverse })= \pm\left|\frac{V_z Q_{\text {circle }}}{I_{\text {circle }} d}\right|=+\frac{900 \mathrm{lb}\left(25.06 \mathrm{in}^3\right)}{98.92 \mathrm{in}^4(6.7 \mathrm{in})}=34.03 \mathrm{psi} \\
& \tau_J(\text { transverse })= \pm\left|\frac{V_x Q_{\text {circle }}}{I_{\text {circle }} d}\right|=+\frac{1500 \mathrm{lb}\left(25.06 \mathrm{in}^3\right)}{98.92 \mathrm{in}^4(6.7 \mathrm{in})}=56.72 \mathrm{psi}
\end{aligned}
\]

Finally, we can calculate the total shear stress for each point by
summing the torsional shear stress with the transverse shear stress:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \tau_K=\tau(\text { torsion })+\tau(\text { tranverse })=-274.3 \mathrm{psi}+34.03 \mathrm{psi}=-240.27 \mathrm{psi} \\
& \tau_J=\tau(\text { torsion })+\tau(\text { tranverse })=274.3 \mathrm{psi}+56.72 \mathrm{psi}=331.02 \mathrm{psi}
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{τ\textsubscript{K} = -240.27 psi, τ\textsubscript{J} = 331.02
psi}

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Combined Shear Stress}\label{combined-shear-stress}

Now we can consider the case of bodies having both torsion and
transverse shear stresses. Given a general loading, one may need to
calculate the torque and also identify which of the forces constitute
transverse shear forces. It will be helpful to remember that the
transverse shear forces are the forces in the directions of the
cross-sectional axes and torsion is that component of moment that is
about the longitudinal axis.

The total shear stress equation is:
\(\tau= \pm\left|\frac{T c}{J}\right| \pm\left|\frac{V_H Q_V}{I_V t_V}\right| \pm\left|\frac{V_V Q_H}{I_H t_H}\right|\)

Example 14.6 demonstrates the calculation of total shear stress when
torsion and transverse shear are both acting.

\section{General Combined Stress}\label{general-combined-stress}

Click to expand

Once the total normal stress and total shear stress at a specified point
is calculated, the general stress state can be represented on a stress
element and used to determine principal stresses, principal planes, and
max/min shear stresses.

In example 14.7, the problem from example 14.5 is extended to find the
principal stresses and max/min shear stresses.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Example 14.7:}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

Revisit example 14.5 to find the principal stresses and max/min shear
stresses for point P on the post:

{[}figure{]}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, breakable, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, colback=white, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, titlerule=0mm, arc=.35mm, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, rightrule=.15mm, title={Solution}, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black]

In example 14.5 the total shear stress for point P was found to be
positive 6.094 MPa.

To find the principal stresses, we must finish finding the general
stress state by also finding the normal stresses and then use the
principal stress equations or Mohr's Circle.

The normal stress for this problem only arises from the bending around
the x and y axes (the cross-sectional axes) since there is no force in
the longitudinal z direction and there is no pressure involved. The
bending stress will be in the z direction since that is the longitudinal
direction.

In addition, since P is on the x axis, it will experience no stress from
the moment around the x-axis, Mx, so all the normal stress comes from
the bending around the y axis, My.

As discussed in example 14.5, if we consider the FBD of the section cut
at P shown below, we know by inspection that the internal reactions at P
will be the same magnitude and direction as the applied. This is because
the reactions at the support will be equal and opposite to the applied
and the internal reactions are the opposite of those.

{[}figure{]}

The internal moment reaction around the y-axis, My, can then be
calculated as:

\[
\sum M_y=(-94 kN)(150 \mathrm{~mm})=-14100 \text{ kN} \text{ mm} \text { or } 14100 \text{ kN} \text{ mm} \text { clockwise }
\]

The bending stress for point P will be positive since the clockwise
moment around the y-axis means that the post will curve into the plane
of the screen and look as shown below from the positive y side view. The
cross-section is also shown with the tail of the representative moment
arrow on the P side of the cross-section, indicating that everything
below the y-axis will be in tension.

{[}figure{]}

Recalling Iy = 40.96 x 10-6 m4 from Example 14.5, the normal stress at P
is then:

\[
\sigma_{P z}=\frac{M_y x}{I_y}=\frac{14100 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}(0.06 \mathrm{~m})}{40.96 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^4}=20.7 \mathrm{MPa}
\]

Now that the total shear stress and total normal stress are known, the
stress state can be represented on a stress element.

{[}figure{]}

Applying the simplified version of the principal stress equations and
the max/min shear equation (in terms of the general xy plane), we get:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_{1,2}=\frac{\sigma_x+\sigma_y}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2}\right)^2+\tau_{x y}{ }^2} \\
& \tau_{\max , \min }= \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2}\right)^2+\tau_{x y}{ }^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

In this case, since the point P is in the yz plane instead of the xy
plane, we can replace the x subscripts with y and the y subscripts with
z, so the equations become:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_{1,2}=\frac{\sigma_y+\sigma_z}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_y-\sigma_z}{2}\right)^2+\tau_{y z}^2}=\frac{20.7 M P a+0}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{20.7 M P a-0}{2}\right)^2+(6.094 M P a)^2}=22.26 M P a,-1.661 M P a \\
& \tau_{\max , \min }= \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_y-\sigma_z}{2}\right)^2+\tau_{y z}^2}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{20.7 M P a-0}{2}\right)^2+(6.094 M P a)^2}=12.01 M P a,-12.01 M P a
\end{aligned}
\]

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{1} = 22.36 MPa}

\textbf{σ\textsubscript{2} = 22.36 MPa}

\textbf{τ\textsubscript{min} = -12.01 MPa}

\textbf{τ\textsubscript{max} = 12.01 MPa}

The overall general stress state for any given point on a loaded body is
found by calculating and combining all forms of normal stress and all
forms of shear stress.

The combined normal stress at a point comes from normal forces, bending
stress, and pressure. Normal forces are the forces perpendicular to the
cross-section the point in question is on. These are also the forces in
the longitudinal direction. The bending moment contribution to normal
stress comes from bending moments around the centroidal cross-sectional
axes. Both normal forces and bending moments will result in stress in
the longitudinal direction with respect to the location of the
cross-section.

Pressure will result in normal stress in two directions (hoop and
axial). The axial stress will combine with the normal stress from normal
forces and bending moments to result in an overall longitudinal stress.
The hoop stress will be the only stress in that direction for the
situations considered in this text.

Since the stresses are added together, it is important to also
understand the sign of each stress. Compressive stresses are negative
and tensile stresses are positive. In bending, one can visualize the
bending shape of a body to determine if a point will be in tension or
compression or use the visual aid described in section 4.1.1. Internal
pressure will always be tensile.

The combined shear stress at a point comes from torsion and transverse
shear forces. The torsional moment is the moment about the longitudinal
axis. The transverse shear forces are the forces in the directions of
the cross-sectional axes. The signs for shear stress are determined by
drawing the stress element and considering the direction of the internal
torque or shear force on the cut edge of the element relative to the
positive and negative faces of the element.

Until now, our focus has been primarily on meeting strength and
deflection criteria. While these aspects are crucial, it's equally
important to ensure the structure's stability. In this chapter, we will
delve into the stability analysis of long and slender members subjected
to compressive loading, commonly referred to as columns. Some examples
are shown in figure 15.1. When the compressive load reaches a critical
point, columns may undergo sudden sideways deflection, a phenomenon
known as buckling.~ After buckling, a column is unable to support any
further load. This chapter will focus on long, slender, homogeneous,
axial compression members, otherwise known as columns.

\begin{figure}[H]

\section{Euler's Formula for
Buckling}\label{eulers-formula-for-buckling}

Click to expand

Even in ideal conditions, buckling often occurs for long slender members
at loads significantly lower than the material's crushing or compression
limit. When a long slender object is subjected to axial loading, it may
buckle once the load reaches a critical threshold known as the critical
load, P\textsubscript{cr}. At this point, the object experiences
significant lateral deflection perpendicular to the load direction, so
columns should be designed such that the applied load does not exceed
the critical load.

Buckling of a ruler (long slender member) is depicted in figure 15.2.
The ruler in the left and center photos is subjected to axial load P
that is less than the critical load, P\textsubscript{cr}. This is known
as stable equilibrium. In the photo on the right, the axial load, P,
exceeded the critical load P\textsubscript{cr}, causing a significant
lateral deflection. This is known as unstable equilibrium.

\begin{figure}[H]

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Stability}}{Stability}}\label{stability}

We can consider stability by using a simplified model of a pinned-pinned
column. This column will consist of two ridged bars connected with a pin
and a spring with a stiffness k, as shown in figure 15.3a. When the
load, P, is small, the system remains vertical, and the spring is
unstretched. If point C is displaced to the right a small amount, Δ, the
spring will produce a force F = kΔ, as shown in figure 15.3b. This force
is used to resist the horizontal forces, P\textsubscript{x} = Ptanθ, as
shown in figure 15.3c.

\sin \theta \sim \theta \text { and } \tan \theta \sim \theta
\]

so

\[
\Delta=\theta \frac{L}{2} \text { and } 2 P_x=2 P \theta
\]

Using the spring restoring force equation F=kΔ, then substituting in for
Δ we have:

\[
F=k \theta \frac{L}{2}
\]

If the spring restoring force is greater than the axial force, then we
have a stable equilibrium.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& F>P \\
& k \theta \frac{L}{2}>2 P \theta
\end{aligned}
\]

The θ cancels out, and we can solve for P:

\[
P<\frac{k L}{4}
\]

Similarly we can solve for the expression for unstable equilibrium F
\textless{} P:

\[
P>\frac{k L}{4}
\]

The point at which F = P is crucial as it is the line between stable and
unstable equilibrium. We call this the critical load
P\textsubscript{cr}:

\[
P_{c r}=\frac{k L}{4}
\]

Thus, if the load P exceeds P\textsubscript{cr}, then the system will be
unstable, and if P is less than P\textsubscript{cr}, then the system
will be stable. We will use P\textsubscript{cr} in the next section to
determine the bucking load of columns.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Euler's
Formula}}{Euler's Formula}}\label{eulers-formula}

As mentioned in earlier sections, members can fail due to material
yielding or fracturing. However, instability represents another critical
failure mechanism that requires consideration. We will use Euler's
formula to calculate the theoretical buckling load. To do this, we will
start with the simplest of columns, pinned-pinned end connections. This
means that the column cannot translate but can rotate as shown in figure
15.4.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH15s PNGs/figure 15.4.png}

}

\caption{Figure 15.4: Pinned-pinned axially loaded column.}

\end{figure}%

Columns are similar to beams rotated 90 degrees, so we can use what we
already know about the elastic curve.

\[
\frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}=\frac{M}{E I}
\]

We can use the free-body diagram in figure 15.4c to sum moments about
any point on the lower column section.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sum M=0=M+P y \\
& M=-P y
\end{aligned}
\]

We can now substitute this expression into the elastic curve equation:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}=\frac{-P y}{E I} \\
& \frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}+\left(\frac{P}{E I}\right) y=0
\end{aligned}
\]

This is a linear, homogeneous, second-order differential equation with
constant coefficients, which has a general solution of:

\[
y=C_1 \sin \left(\sqrt{\frac{P}{E I}} x\right)+C_2 \cos \left(\sqrt{\frac{P}{E I}} x\right)
\]

The two constants, C\textsubscript{1} and C\textsubscript{2}, can be
determined by imploring boundary conditions.~ Since y = 0 at x = 0 and y
= 0 when x = L. The first condition gives:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&0  =C_1(0)+C_2(1) \\
& \text { so } C_2  =0
\end{aligned}
\]

The second boundary condition, x = L when y = 0 results in:

\[
0=C_1 \sin \left(\sqrt{\frac{P}{E I}} x\right)+0
\]

The equation is satisfied if C\textsubscript{1} = 0. However, this is a
trivial solution that implies y = 0 and there is no lateral deflection.
For the nontrivial solution, the sine function must be equal to zero,
which requires:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sqrt{\frac{P}{E I}} L=n \pi \\
& \text {where } n=1, 2, 3, 4,...
\end{aligned}
\]

The smallest value of P occurs when n = 1; substituting this and
rearranging gives us Euler's formula:

\[
P_{c r}=\frac{\pi^2 E I}{L^2}
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  P\textsubscript{cr} = critical axial load on the column just before it
  buckles {[}N, lb{]}. Note that this load must be less than that of the
  load that would cause the stress in the columns to exceed the yield
  stress, or the column will fail due to yield stress before it buckles.
\item
  E = Modulus of elasticity of the material {[}Pa, psi{]}
\item
  I = Moment of inertia for the column {[}m\textsuperscript{4},
  in\textsuperscript{4}{]}
\item
  L = Unsupported length of the column~ (pinned=pinned connection) {[}m,
  in{]}
\end{itemize}

This is named after the Swiss mathematician
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler}{Leonhard Euler} who
developed this formula in 1744. Other bucking modes can exist (n = 2, n
= 3, n = 4, etc.) but are less common as the load required for those
higher modes would be much larger. The first three bucking loads can be
seen in figure 15.5.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH15s PNGs/figure 15.5.png}

}

\caption{Figure 15.5: First three buckling modes}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Bucking
Direction}}{Bucking Direction}}\label{bucking-direction}

Columns that are pinned at both ends and have circular or square cross
sections (where the moments of inertia are the same about any axis)
could buckle in any direction. However, columns that do not have a
symmetric cross-section will take place in the plane perpendicular to
the principal axis of the minimum moment of inertia. For example, the
ruler in figure 15.2 has a rectangular cross-section. When a compressive
force is applied to the ruler, it will buckle about the axis with the
smaller moment of inertia. The axis of bucking might not be obvious for
sections that are not symmetric. During buckling analysis, it's
essential to evaluate both directions to determine the axis with the
lowest moment of inertia. Subsequently, this axis is utilized for
computing the critical buckling load. Figure 15.6 illustrates column
buckling of wood supports.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{images/CH15s PNGs/figure 15.6.jpg}

}

\caption{Figure 15.6: Buckling of wooden studs.}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Critical
Stress}}{Critical Stress}}\label{critical-stress}

We can use the Euler bucking equation to calculate the critical stress
for a column by setting I=Ar\textsuperscript{2} where A is the
cross-sectional area and r is the radius of gyration. For a more
comprehensive discussion on the radious of gyration, see the
\href{https://engineeringstatics.org/radius-of-gyration-sec.html}{Engineering
Statics} book by Baker and Haynes.

\[
\sigma_{c r}=\frac{P_{c r}}{A}=\frac{\pi^2 E\left(A r^2\right)}{A L^2}
\]

Rearranging we have:

\[
\sigma_{c r}=\frac{\pi^2 E}{\left(\frac{L}{r}\right)^2}
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  σ\textsubscript{cr} = critical stress on the column just before it
  buckles {[}Pa, psi{]}. Note that this stress must be less than that of
  the yield stress, or the column will fail due to yield stress before
  it buckles.
\item
  E = Modulus of elasticity of the material {[}Pa, psi{]}
\item
  L = Unsupported length of the column (pinned=pinned connection) {[}m,
  in{]}
\item
  r = Smallest radius of gyration of the column {[}m, in{]}
\end{itemize}

The quantity in the denominator, L/r, is called the slenderness ratio of
the column. Many times columns are classified using the slenderness
ratio as short, intermediate, and long. The smallest value of the radius
of gyration is used to find the critical stress.

A plot of the critical stress versus the slenderness ratio is shown in
figure 15.7. For larger slenderness ratios the curve is hyperbolic. For
smaller slenderness ratios, the critical stress is equal to the yield
stress of the material. This graph illustrates that if the critical
stress calculated using Euler's equation is greater than the yield
stress that is of no interest. The column will yield before it has the
chance to buckle.

\]

We will start with calculating the critical load using Euler's Bucking
Formula. Note that we can confidently say that this column will buckle
about the y-axis since the moment of inertia in the y-direction is the
smallest.

\[

& P_{c r}=518.6 \text{ kips}
\end{aligned}
\]

This represents the load at which any increase in applied load will
cause the column to buckle. We will calculate the stress associated with
this critical load.

\[
\sigma_{c r}=\frac{P_{c r}}{A}=\frac{518.6 \text{ kips}}{8.8 \text{ in}^2}=58.7 \text{ ksi}
\]

Since this stress is larger than the yield stress of the steel
(σ\textsubscript{y} = 50 ksi) the column will not buckle first it will
fail due to yielding. We can calculate the force using the stress of an
axial member formula discussed in chapter 2.

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\sigma_{cr} =\frac{P}{A} \\
& 50 \text{ ksi} =\frac{P}{8.84 \text{ in}^2} \\
&p =442 \text{ kips}

\section{Effect of Supports}\label{effect-of-supports}

Click to expand

We derived Euler's equation for bucking with pinned-pinned supports (the
simplest case). However, in many cases, columns are supported by other
end conditions. Just as we derived Euler's formula for bucking by
solving a differential equation for the pinned-pinned conditions, the
same can be done for other types of support cases. We will derive one
more here.

Let's consider the case where a column is fixed at one end and free at
the other end as shown in figure 15.8a. Summing moments at the cut end
of the free body diagram in figure 15.9 we get M=P(δ-y).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4.14583in,height=\textheight]{images/CH15s PNGs/figure 15.8.png}

}

\caption{Figure 15.8: Column with a fixed base and a free end.}

\end{figure}%

We can now write the differential equation using the elastic curve
equation:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& E I \frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}=P(\delta-y) \\
& \frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}+\left(\frac{P}{E I}\right) y=\left(\frac{P}{E I}\right) \delta
\end{aligned}
\]

Since the right side is not equal to zero, this equation is
nonhomogeneous (note this differs from our earlier derivation for the
pinned-pinned connection). There will be a particular and complementary
solution.

\[
y=C_1 \sin \left(\sqrt{\frac{P}{E I} x}\right)+C_2 \cos \left(\sqrt{\frac{P}{E I} x}\right)+\delta
\]

We can now employ boundary conditions to solve for the constants. At x =
0, y = 0, so C\textsubscript{2} = δ. Also at x = 0, dy/dx=0, so
C\textsubscript{1}=0. This leads us to the following deflection curve:

\[
y=\delta\left(1-\cos \left(\sqrt{\frac{P}{E I}} x\right)\right)
\]

At the free end of the column, x = L, we know that y = δ so:

\[
0=\delta \cos \left(\sqrt{\frac{P}{E I} L}\right)
\]

The trivial solution δ = 0 shows that no matter what the P value no
buckling will occur. So we have:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& 0=\cos \left(\sqrt{\frac{P}{E I} L}\right) \\
& \sqrt{\frac{P}{E I}} L=\frac{n \pi}{2} \\
& \text{where n=1, 3, 5,...}
\end{aligned}
\]

The smallest critical load happens at n = 1, results in:

\[
P_{c r}=\frac{\pi^2 E I}{(2 L)^2}
\]

Other support conditions can be derived in a similar manner.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Effective
Length}}{Effective Length}}\label{effective-length}

The critical load equation for the fixed-free column differs from the
equation for the pinned-pinned column only by the length L being
multiplied by a factor of 2. We will adjust the column length L to
denote the distance between the points on the column where the moment is
zero. This distance is referred to as the \textbf{\emph{effective
length}}, L\textsubscript{e}. For a pinned-pinned column, L =
L\textsubscript{e}, as illustrated in figure 15.9. As derived above, for
a column with a fixed base and a free end, L\textsubscript{e} = 2L. Two
other common end conditions are depicted in this figure relating L to
L\textsubscript{e}. We can use one general equation for any support
condition by replacing the effective length with KL, where K represents
the effective length factor.

\[
P_{c r}=\frac{\pi^2 E I}{(K L)^2}
\]

and

\[
\sigma_{c r}=\frac{\pi^2 E}{\left(\frac{K L}{r}\right)^2}
\]

You can find the effective length factor, K, below each of the end
conditions in figure 15.9.

about the y-axis since the moment of inertia in the y-direction is the
smallest.

\[

& P_{cr}=\frac{\pi^2 E I^2}{(k L)^2}=\frac{\pi^2(29000 \text{ ksi})\left(16.7{\text{ in}^4}\right)}{\left(2 \cdot 8 \mathrm{ft} \cdot 12{\text{ in/ft}}\right)^2} \\
& P_{c r}=129.7 \text { kips} \\
&
\end{aligned}
\]

This represents the load at which any increase in applied load will
cause the column to buckle. We will calculate the stress associated with
this critical load.

\[
\sigma_{c r}=\frac{P_{cr}}{A}=\frac{129.7 \mathrm{~K}}{8.84 \text{ in}^2}=14.7 \text{ ksi}
\]

Since this stress is smaller than the yield stress of the steel
(σ\textsubscript{y} = 50 ksi) the column will buckle first at a critical
load of 129.7 kips.

and E = 29,000 ksi), is it adequate?

\end{center}

We will consult the table in the Appendix to get the section properties
of a W12x50 section. We will start with calculating the critical load
using Euler's Bucking Formula. The brace at the midpoint of the column
changes the length of the column in the weak direction. This doesn't
make it obvious which axis the column will buckle about so we will need
to check both the strong and weak directions.

\textbf{Strong axis}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& P_{cr}=\frac{\pi^2 E I^2}{(k L)^2}=\frac{\pi^2(29000 \text{ ksi})\left(391{\text{ in}^4}\right)}{\left(0.7 \cdot 25 \text{ ft} \cdot 12{\text{ in/ft}}\right)^2} \\
& P_{c r}=2538 \text { kips} \\
&
\end{aligned}
\]

We use the general form of Euler's bucking equation. Since the end
supports are pinned-fixed, we use K = 0.7. We calculated that the
critical load in the strong direction to be 2538 kips.

We will compare this to buckling about the weak axis. The values of I,
K, and L will change. The L value changes because the column is braced
at the midpoint, so the column has a shorter distance to buckle about.
The K value can be tricky. There were no details about the brace; we
don't know if the brace will provide an end condition like a fixed or
pinned end. So, we will calculate the worst case, which would be a
pinned-pinned end condition (this makes the denominator the largest, so
the result will be the smallest).

\textbf{Weak axis}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& P_{cr}=\frac{\pi^2 E I^2}{(k L)^2}=\frac{\pi^2(29000 \text{ ksi})\left(56.3{\text{ in}^4}\right)}{\left(1 \cdot 12.5 \text{ ft} \cdot 12{\text{ in/ft}}\right)^2} \\
& P_{c r}=716 \text { kips} \\
&
\end{aligned}
\]

We calculated that the critical load in the weak direction to be 716
kips. This means that if the column were to buckle, it would be about
the weak axis since this load was smaller. Since the critical buckling
load is greater than the 650 kip applied load our column is adequate.
However, we need to calculate the load due to yielding of the steel.

\textbf{Yield}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_{y0}=\frac{P}{4} \therefore P=(50 \text{ ksi})\left(14.6 \text{ in}^2\right) \\
& P_{y0}=730 \text{ kips}
\end{aligned}
\]

We calculated a yielding load of 730 kips. Interpreting these results:
The column is adequate for a 650 kip load. Failure would first occur by
bucking in the weak direction if the load were increased to 716 kips. It
should be noted that we did not apply any safety factors. In civil
engineering, design codes for steel columns designate how to apply
safety factors to the loading and the capacity.

Let's talk about the brace, what would happen to the capacity of the
columns if the brace was not there? We will recalculate the critical
load for bucking bout the weak direction.

\textbf{No brace}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& P_{cr}=\frac{\pi^2 E I^2}{(k L)^2}=\frac{\pi^2(29000 \text{ ksi})\left(56.3{\text{ in}^4}\right)}{\left(0.7 \cdot 25 \mathrm{ft} \cdot 12{\text{ in/ft}}\right)} \\
& P_{c r}=365 \text { kips} \\
&
\end{aligned}
\]

Notice how much lower this was than the braced condition. If the column
was not braced it would not be adequate for the applied load.
