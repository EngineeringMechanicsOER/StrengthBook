## Introduction {.unnumbered}

Mechanics can be broadly categorized in three parts, of which this text covers one. **Statics** explores the effects of *external loads* applied to *rigid bodies* in *equilibrium*. **Dynamics** explores the effects of *external loads* applied to *rigid bodies* that are not in *equilibrium.* In ***Mechanics of Deformable Bodies***, the subject of this text, we explore the effects of both *external* and *internal loads* on *non-rigid bodies* in *equilibrium*.

Since bodies in this text are in equilibrium, many of the principles from statics still apply. However, because these bodies are non-rigid, a much deeper analysis is required. Objects in this text will deform. When loads are applied, they will change their shapes. They will elongate and bend and twist and, if we're not careful, may even break. Real objects are deformable, and engineers must take great care to ensure that their designs do not break or deform so much that they are unfit for purpose.

Have you ever wondered why civil engineers tend to use certain materials for bridges and buildings, while automotive engineers use an entirely different set of materials in cars? Meanwhile, aerospace engineers don't make rockets out of the same materials that biomedical engineers use for prosthetics. There are many material properties that determine applications that a given material may, or may not, be suitable for. Two fundamental concepts explored in this text are stress, which helps us determine whether an object will break under a given load, and strain, which relates to the object's deformation.

This text begins with an overview of stress and strain. Depending on how external loads are applied, there are a variety of potential internal loads on our object. You are likely already familiar with these loads and their effects, even if you haven't explicitly though about them.

-   **Axial forces** push or pull on a body. They cause elongation and compression. For example, imagine pulling on the ends of an elastic band. The band will stretch significantly. Objects may be pulled apart or crushed by this load. Imagine doing the same with a piece of chalk. There will be a small amount of deformation and the chalk will break.

-   **Bending moments** act to bend an object. Imagine propping a long piece of plywood up on two supports and standing in the middle. The wood will bend. If you jump and land hard enough, it may even break.

-   **Shear forces** are created when one body (or part of a body) slides relative to another. They commonly occur in conjunction with bending moments.

-   **Torsional moments** act to twist an object. Imagine holding the ends of a cable and rotating your wrists so that the cable twists around itself along its length. You will see the cable rotate through ever larger angles. Twist it too far and it will break.

This text will explore the effects of these loads and expand your understanding of these effects. It aims to describe these effects in a conceptual way, building on your existing understanding. Once these effects are understood conceptually, we'll learn how to calculate the exact amount of deformation and the exact size of the stress created. We'll learn to make sure that our designs stay within appropriate limits. There will necessarily be a significant amount of math involved in these calculations but it is just as important, if not more so, that we understand the principles behind those calculations. As such, this text leads with conceptual descriptions and realistic examples before working numerical problems.

The stress and strain resulting from these four types of load account for the majority of this text. Once they are thoroughly understood, more advanced topics necessary for a thorough understanding of these fundamental concepts are included. Upon completion of a course using this text, students will be able to explain the stress and strain observed under different types of load, calculate the amount of stress and strain, and design individual components to be within acceptable limits for both. Students will be prepared for advanced courses in a variety of engineering disciplines, and will be able to apply their knowledge to realistic scenarios.
