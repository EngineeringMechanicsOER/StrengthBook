    "text": "What is Mechanics?\nMechanics can be broadly categorized in three parts, of which this text covers one. Statics explores the effects of external loads applied to rigid bodies in equilibrium. Dynamics explores the effects of external loads applied to rigid bodies that are not in equilibrium. In Strength of Materials, we explore the mechanics of deformable bodies, learning about the effects of both external and internal loads on non-rigid bodies in equilibrium.\nSince bodies in this text are in equilibrium, many of the principles from statics still apply. However, because these bodies are non-rigid, a much deeper analysis is required. Objects in this text will deform. When loads are applied, they will change their shapes. They will elongate and bend and twist and, if we’re not careful, may even break. Real objects are deformable, and engineers must take great care to ensure that their designs do not break or deform so much that they are unfit for purpose.\nHave you ever wondered why civil engineers tend to use certain materials for bridges and buildings, while automotive engineers use an entirely different set of materials in cars? Meanwhile, aerospace engineers don’t make rockets out of the same materials that biomedical engineers use for prosthetics. There are many material properties that determine applications that a given material may, or may not, be suitable for. Two fundamental concepts explored in this text are stress, which helps us determine whether an object will break under a given load, and strain, which relates to the object’s deformation.\nDepending on how external loads are applied, there are a variety of potential internal loads on our object. You are likely already familiar with these loads and their effects, even if you haven’t explicitly thought about them.\n\nAxial forces push or pull on a body. They cause elongation and compression. For example, imagine pulling on the ends of an elastic band. The band will stretch significantly. Objects may be pulled apart or crushed by this load. Imagine doing the same with a piece of chalk. There will be a small amount of deformation and the chalk will break.\nBending moments act to bend an object. Imagine propping a long piece of plywood up on two supports and standing in the middle. The wood will bend. If you jump and land hard enough, it may even break.\nShear forces are created when one body (or part of a body) slides relative to another. They commonly occur in conjunction with bending moments.\nTorsional moments act to twist an object. Imagine holding the ends of a cable and rotating your wrists so that the cable twists around itself along its length. You will see the cable rotate through ever larger angles. Twist it too far and it will break.\n\nThis text will explore the effects of these loads and expand your understanding of these effects. It aims to describe these effects in a conceptual way, building on your existing understanding. Once these effects are understood conceptually, we’ll learn how to calculate the exact amount of deformation and the exact size of the stress created as well as how to make sure that our designs stay within appropriate limits.\n\n\nScope\nThis book is intended for use in introductory undergraduate Mechanics of Materials courses. Such courses are typically early in the curriculum, following Statics and generally serving as a prerequisite to more advanced Solid Mechanics courses. As such, this book begins with a review of static equilibrium before introducing the concepts of stress and strain and the relationship between them, along with pertinent material properties. The following chapters explore stress and deformation under four loading conditions: axial loads, torsional moments, bending moments, and transverse loads. Methods for determining internal loads and relevant geometric properties are included.\nOnce stress and deformation under each loading condition is well understood, stress transformation is introduced. This is followed by a brief discussion of thin-walled pressure vessels before tying together many of the previous chapters in an exploration of combined loading scenarios. Finally, column buckling is examined as a potential failure mode.\n\n\nTarget Audience\nThis textbook is intended for a wide range of engineering undergraduate students. The content is fundamental to several disciplines including mechanical, civil, aerospace, and materials engineering. This text covers fundamental skills and concepts that students will rely on throughout their studies and their careers.\n\n\nMotivation\nExisting textbooks covering this material are expensive for students and tightly controlled by their publisher. There are some scattered open resources to aid student learning, but this book provides a cohesive resource that covers a typical Mechanics of Materials course from start to finish. It is free to use and instructors are free to adapt the book to their specific needs.\nOur experience teaching this class is that students report rarely using the textbook for anything beyond assigned homework problems. They often find the books dense and impenetrable, and struggle in a course they perceive to contain many disparate topics. This text attempts to more clearly demonstrate the links between the various topics and help students realize that the course is really about the application of just a handful of concepts. In our experience, students who make these connections find the course much easier than those who don’t.\n\n\nApproach and Features\nA cohesive narrative across the book. Each chapter begins with a roadmap showing how the material of the chapter relates to the other material in the course. This is presented alongside a paragraph explaining the purpose of the chapter and where it ties into the course. Relevant topics are then introduced with a reason for studying the topic, the underlying concepts are explored, and any relevant equations are provided with derivations where appropriate. Applications are demonstrated and each chapter ends with a summary of the key takeaways and equations.\nConceptual understanding first, followed by numerical problem solving. Conceptual understanding is key to performing well not only in this course but also in subsequent courses and as an engineer. Topics are approached conceptually first, with realistic applications used as a tool to aid understanding. Extensive worked examples are used liberally to demonstrate application of the concepts to numerical problems. Worked examples include thorough explanations of what is being done to solve the problem and why.\nDiverse problem sets. Practice makes perfect and it is vital that students have diverse and extensive problem sets to practice applying the material. A large number of problems are included with each chapter, ranging from traditional idealized problems to problems with real-world applications in a variety of engineering disciplines.\nThis course is often high-enrollment and instructors often teach multiple sections. With so many students, grading can be a challenge. The problem sets in this book have been recreated online with an interface that can intelligently provide feedback to students. Timely feedback is so important to student understanding. More than just letting students know whether they got the right or wrong numerical answer, this feedback helps students identify and understand their mistakes.\nColor coding and collapsible content. Each chapter begins with defined learning objectives. Lists of learning objectives are blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nThese blocks include leaning objectives for the chapter\nThese are short statements describing what you should be able to achieve upon completing the chapter\n\n\n\nChapters are organized into short sections. When opening a chapter, the learning objectives and Introduction section will be visible, while the other chapter sections are collapsed. Each section is independently expandable to aid navigation. Sections include explanatory text and worked examples for practice. Worked examples are green. They include an initial expandable box containing the problem statement, and a separately expandable box containing the worked solution. Student may choose to access the solution at any time, or attempt the problem themselves before checking their solution against the worked example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorked Example - This block is expandable\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you’ll find the problem statement and any relevant diagrams. The solution is hidden behind another block, allowing you to attempt the problem before viewing the solution, if desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution - This block is expandable\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you’ll find a full worked solution and final answer. The solution includes the final answer, all calculations, and an explanation of why each calculation is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost sections end with step-by-step instructions for solving problems related to that section. These are orange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step\n\n\n\n\nThese boxes contain a numbered list of steps for approaching problems related to each section\nThese are helpful for reminding yourself how to approach problems\nHowever, they lack the conceptual detail that is vital for understanding\n\n\n\nEach chapter ends with a Summary section containing key takeaways and key equations. Like the learning objectives, these are blue.\n\n\nOrganization\nThis book begins with a review of static equilibrium for single members, trusses, and frames. Internal loads are then introduced.\nChapters 2 and 3 contain an overview of stress and strain, and chapter 4 discusses the relationship between them. Important material properties such as yield stress, elastic modulus, and Poisson’s ratio are introduced, and Hooke’s Law is applied in one and three dimensions. Thermal strain and factor of safety is also introduced here.\nThe following chapters cover stress and strain under various loading conditions. Chapter 5 covers axial stress, deformation, stress concentrations, and thermal deformation. Statically indeterminate problems are also introduced here and repeated several times throughout the text. Chapter 6 covers torsional stress, deformation, power transmission, and statically indeterminate problems again.\nBefore considering bending and shear loads, Chapter 7 reviews several methods for determining internal shear force and bending moment. Equilibrium methods, integration, and graphical methods are all described. Chapter 8 provides methods for determining geometric properties such as centroid and 2nd moment of area. Chapters 9 and 10 then discuss bending stress and shear stress respectively. These equations necessarily rely on the material from Chapters 7 and 8. Chapter 11 then covers beam deflection by integration, by superposition, and the application of these methods to statically indeterminate problems.\nOnce students have a thorough understanding of the effects of these four different loads, stress transformation is introduced in Chapter 12. General stress transformation in 2D as well as determination of the principal stresses and maximum in-plane shear stress are discussed first. Mohr’s circle is then discussed as an alternative method, and is expanded to cover out-f-plane shear stress.\nChapter 13 covers spherical and cylindrical thin-walled pressure vessels. Chapter 14 brings much of the earlier content together and introduced combined loading problems. Eccentric axial loads are discussed first as a specific subset of combined load problems. The principles are then expanded to general combined load problems that include any or all of the previously discussed loads.\nFinally, buckling of columns is considered as a potential failure mode. Students wrap up the course with a reminder that both stress and deformation must be considered and that anything they work on must satisfactorily resist both.",

    "text": "Click to expand\n\nLike in Statics, all bodies and structures discussed in this text will be assumed to be in static equilibrium. Unlike Statics, which assumed that all bodies were rigid, bodies in this text are deformable. In order to determine how an applied loading situation affects any given body or structure, and potentially causes it to deform, we must start by applying statics to establish the distribution of forces and moments within the body. This will be the first step of many problems. This chapter will present a review of those aspects of statics concepts that will be prevalent throughout this course.\nExternal forces and moments are the forces and moments that act on the boundaries of a system. They are the loads that are applied arbitrarily (weight, wind, pressure, etc.), as well as the reactions they induce in the supporting elements (pins, rollers, welds, etc.). In the case of external reactions, the word “reaction” refers to the forces and/or moments exerted by the supports on the body in reaction to the other loading in order to keep the body in equilibrium.\nFinding the external reactions will be the first step of many of the types of problems that will be covered in this text. This process will entail first drawing a free body diagram (FBD) of the body, or a sketch of the body freed from its supports, which shows the applied and reaction forces and moments. The reactions that correspond to the most common supports are illustrated below in Table 1.1\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Free body diagrams for common supports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport\nReactions\nFree body diagram\n\n\n\n\nPin\nForce acting in an unknown direction. Since the direction is unknown, show as x and y components on the FBD\n\n\n\nNormal supports\n(including rollers, rockers, and smooth contact surface)\nForce in the direction normal to the support. Since the direction is known (normal to the support), show as total force in the known direction.\n\n\n\nCables\nForce in the direction of the cable. Should always be drawn in tension.\n\n\n\nFixed support\nForce in an unknown direction (so draw x and y components of force) as well as reaction couple moment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that while pins and fixed supports react with a force in a specific direction, both the magnitude and direction of the force are unknown until equilibrium equations are applied to solve for them. Instead of expressing the components of the unknown F in terms of the unknown θ, the reactions are normally shown as the components Fx and Fy. Once they are found, the overall magnitude of the force in the pin and its direction can be calculated \\(\\left(F=\\sqrt{F_x^2+F_y^2}, \\tan \\theta_x=\\frac{F_y}{F_x}\\right)\\).\nSection 1.1 reviews equilibrium of members and frames in two dimensions, including the analysis of two-force members and multi-force members.\nSection 1.2 addresses internal loads, including normal force, shear force, and bending moment.\nSection 1.3 reviews equilibrium in three dimensions.",

    "text": "1.1 Equilibrium in Two Dimensions\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nOnce the FBD is drawn, the next step is to apply the equilibrium equations. In two dimensions (x-y plane), these are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sum F_x=0 \\quad \\sum F_y=0 \\quad \\sum M_{any~point}=0}\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nSince there are three equations, a statically determinate problem should have no more than 3 unknowns.\nExample 1.1 illustrates the process of finding external reactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.1  \n\n\nA 3 ft beam is supported by a pin connection at the wall at point A and a cable at point C as shown. A load is applied 2 ft away from point A. Find the force in pin A as well as the tensile force in the cable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Draw the FBD\nNote that a guess needs to be made for the positive or negative sense of Ax and Ay, but the tensile force from a cable should always be shown to pull away from the body. The correct sense of Ax and Ay will be determined by obtaining positive or negative answers for the values. A positive answer means the direction was correctly assumed and a negative answer means the force should be in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Apply equilibrium equations\nStarting with the moment about A will eliminate two unknowns from the equation so that tensile force T can be solved for. Then substitute the result from T into the other two equations to find Ax and Ay.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum M_A=T \\sin (30^{\\circ}) * 3{~ft}-1,200{~lb }*2{~ft}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad T=1,600 {~lb} \\\\\n& \\sum F_x=-A_x-T \\cos (30^{\\circ})=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad A_x=-1,384.6{~lb} \\\\\n& \\sum F_y=A_y+T \\sin (30^{\\circ})-1200{~lb}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad A_y= 400{~lb}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince a negative answer was obtained for Ax, that force actually acts in the positive x direction.\nThe total force in pin A is then \\(F_A=\\sqrt{A_x^2+A_y^2}=1,441{~lb}\\)\nAnswer: T = 1,600 lb, FA = 1,441 lb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Two Force Members\nOne special type of pin connection for which the direction of the reaction force is known is one in which the pin is connected to a two-force member. Contrary to the name, a two-force member is not necessarily a member on which only two forces are applied, but rather it is a member on which forces are applied at only two locations. A two-force member can be any shape, as is demonstrated in Figure 1.1. One easy way to recognize a two-force member is to note the presence of only two connection points (such as two pins) but no other locations at which a force or moment couple is applied. Once a member is recognized to be a two-force member, it can be concluded that the resultant force at both connection points will be equal in magnitude (so FA = FB in Figure 1.1) and opposite in direction and follow a line of action that goes through the connections. For a straight member, it can also be concluded that the force within the two-force member (internal reaction as will be discussed in Section 1.1) is equal to the reaction force in the pin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Illustrations of two force members showing the line of action of the reaction force passing through the joints. Note that FA = FB.\n\n\n\nThe presence and recognition of two force members can make some otherwise statically indeterminate problems become statically determinate. This is demonstrated in Example 1.2 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.2  \n\n\nDetermine the force in pin C and in pin A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Draw the FBD\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this FBD, it appears that there are 4 unknowns and therefore not solvable by just 3 equilibrium equations. However, recognizing that bar AB is a two-force member (since there is a pin at A and a pin at B but no other forces acting on that bar), it can be taken as known that the line of action of the reaction force at A goes through points A and B. Thus, the FBD can be redrawn with just 3 unknowns:\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Apply equilibrium equations\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum M_C=F_A \\cos \\left(50^{\\circ}\\right)*(5{~m}) \\sin \\left(50^{\\circ}\\right)-F_A \\sin \\left(50^{\\circ}\\right) *\\left(4{~m}+5{~m}\\left(\\cos \\left(50^{\\circ}\\right)\\right)-4,000{~ N}*2{~m}=0\\right. \\\\\n& \\sum F_x=F_A \\cos \\left(50^{\\circ}\\right)+C_x=0 \\\\\n& \\sum F_y=F_A \\sin \\left(50^{\\circ}\\right)-4,000{~N}+C_y=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSolving (1) for FA yields FA = 2,611 N\nSubstituting this result into (1) and (2) yields Cx = - 1,678 N and Cy = 2,000 N\n\\[\nF_C=\\sqrt{C_x^2+C_y^2}=2,611{~N}\n\\]\nRecall that, for rigid bodies, forces may be slid along their line of action. We could slide force \\(F_A\\) to point B. Doing so simplifies our moment equation since the horizontal component of \\(F_A\\) now acts through point C.\n\\[\n\\sum M_C=-F_A \\sin(50^\\circ)*4{~m}+F_A \\cos(50^\\circ)*0+4,000{~N}*2{~m}=0\n\\]\nThis gives us the same result of \\(F_A=2,611{~N}\\) and the rest of the problem proceeds the same way.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: FA = 1,155 N and FC = 1,155 N",

    "section": "1.2 Internal Reactions",
    "text": "1.2 Internal Reactions\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nInternal reactions can refer to forces and moments at connection points between members (such as a pin connecting multiple members of a frame, machine, or truss), as well as to reactions at any point in a continuous body (for example a point in the middle of a beam). These reactions are the forces and/or moments necessary to hold a structure or a body together and are ultimately the aspect of loading that is needed to determine if and how a body will deform or even break.\n\n1.2.1 Internal reactions at a connection with two force members\nPins that connect members can be represented on an FBD in the same way as pins that connect the structure to external supports. That is, the reaction would be drawn as the two components of the overall force. However, the connected members would be considered as separate bodies, as if the connecting pin were pulled out and the members separated. The pin reactions would then be drawn on the FBD for each separated member. Since the pin would exert equal and opposite forces on the connected members, one needs to be careful to show the reaction forces in opposite directions on the FBD’s of those members. All three equilibrium equations can be applied separately to each member so one could theoretically solve for 3 times the number of unknowns as separate FBD’s drawn.\nHowever, just as was discussed above, when one of the connected members is a two-force member, the reaction at the pin will be known to follow a line of action that goes through the points of application of the forces on the two-force member. Example 1.3 demonstrates these concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.3  \n\n\nA plant hanger is secured to a wall with a pin and additionally supported by a brace that is pin connected to the hanger at B and to the wall at C. Determine the external reactions at A and C as well as the reaction in the internal pin B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we do not notice that BC is a two-force member, we would approach the problem by separating the brace from the hanger and drawing an FBD of each part separately. Notice that Bx and By are drawn in opposite directions in the two different diagrams since the pin will exert an equal and opposite force on each bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are now 6 unknowns and 6 equilibrium equations (3 equations per body) available to use per bar, so the problem is technically solvable. However, since BC is a two force member (there is a pin force at B and a pin force at C but no other forces at any other point on the bar), it can be taken as known that the reaction force at B follows a line of action that goes through B and C. We can also conclude that the force in pin C is equal to the force in pin B. The FBD of bar AB can be redrawn:\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the components Bx and By replaced with the resultant force FB with known direction, the number of unknowns on bar AB is reduced to 3. These unknowns can be solved for using the equilibrium equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum M_A=F_B\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)*3{~ft}-50{~lb}*7{~ft}=0 \\\\\n& \\sum F_x=-A_x+F_B\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)=0 \\\\\n& \\sum F_y=A_y+F_B\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)-50{~lb}=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSolving the equations (1)-(3) yields FB = 145.8 lb, Ax = 87.5 lb, and Ay = -66.7 lb. Therefore, the pin force in pin B is 145.8 lb and the pin force in A is \\(\\mathrm{A}=\\sqrt{A_x^2+A_y^2}=110{~lb}\\). Since BC is a two-force member, FC = FB.\nAnswer: FA = 110 lb, FB = FC = 146.8 lb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Internal reactions in truss structures\nTruss structures are made up of only two force members. The two main methods of determining internal reactions in planar (2D) truss structures are Method of Joints and Method of Sections. In using Method of Joints, an FBD is drawn of the connecting pins (joints) within the truss. Since all the members connected at any given pin will be two-force members, the reactions can be drawn in known directions. However, since the forces all pass through the same point on the body, the moment equilibrium equation is not useful, so only the forces equilibrium equations can be used for each joint. This means that only two unknowns can be solved for at each joint. This method is most useful when the forces of all the truss members are sought or if the only forces sought are attached to a joint with only two members.\nTo use Method of Sections, a cut is made through the truss structure and analysis is based on the FBD of the intact part of the structure that is to the left of the cut or the intact part of the structure to the right of the cut. The FBD of either given side will show the applied forces and the reaction forces from the members that were cut through. These reactions will be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction between the two sides of the cut. The side to examine is usually based on which one will not require having to find external reactions (if there is a free end to the truss) and/or which one is least complicated to deal with in terms of geometry or applied loads. All three equilibrium equations can generally be effectively applied with Method of Sections, so three unknowns can be solved for with any given cut.\nExample 1.4 demonstrates the use of both Method of Joints and Method of Sections to solve for forces in truss members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.4  \n\n\nDetermine the forces in members ED and EF. Let P1 = 8 kN and P2 = 12 kN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution - Method of Joints\n\n\n\n\n\nWith method of joints, we should always work with a joint that has no more than two unknown forces acting on it. These unknown forces come from either members attached to the joint or from external support reactions. Joint C is a good place to start here, as there are only two unknown forces: BC and CD.\nFBD Joint C\n\n\n\n\n\nAngle Θ can be found by setting up a right angle triangle at C with a base of 1 m and a height of 5 m. Once this angle is known, we can use equilibrium equations to find the forces in members BC and CD. \n\\[\n\\theta=\\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{5}{1}\\right)=78.7^{\\circ} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\sum F_y=C D \\sin \\left(78.7^{\\circ}\\right)-12=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad C D=12.2{~kN} \\\\\n&\\sum F_x=-B C-C D \\cos \\left(78.7^{\\circ}\\right)=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad B D=-15.3{~kN}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince the forces are shown to be tensile in the FBD (the forces are pointed away from the joint), the negative answer indicates that force BD is actually compressive.\nNow that force CD is known to be 12.2 kN in tension, there are two remaining unknowns at joint D: BD and DE.\nFBD Joint D\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know the 12.2 kN force is at angle Θ=78.7° from horizontal. Angle α can be found by considering right angle triangle BDE which has a base of 4 m and a height of 5 m. Once this angle is known, we can use equilibrium equations to find the forces in members BD and DE.\n\\[\n\\alpha=\\tan ^{-1}\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)=51.3^{\\circ} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum F_y&=-12.2 \\sin \\left(78.7^{\\circ}\\right)-B D \\sin \\left(51.3^{\\circ}\\right)=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad B D=-15.3{~kN} \\\\\n\\sum F_x&=-D E-B D \\cos \\left(51.3^{\\circ}\\right)+12.2 \\cos \\left(78.7^{\\circ}\\right)=0 \\\\\n&=-D E-(-15.3) \\cos \\left(51.3^{\\circ}\\right)+12.2 \\cos \\left(78.7^{\\circ}\\right)=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad D E=12{~kN}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nForce BD is 15.3 kN in compression and force DE is 12 kN in tension. Now we need to find force BE. There are two remaining unknowns at joint B: AB and BE.\nFBD Joint B\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sum F_y=B E-8-15.3 \\sin \\left(51.3^{\\circ}\\right)=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad B E=20{~kN}\n\\]\nAnswer: DE = 12 kN (Tensile), BE = 20 kN (Tensile)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution - Method of Sections\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Method of Joints can be used here, it is inefficient. We needed to draw and analyze free body diagrams of joints C, D, and B and keep track of the forces at these joints as well as whether each force was in tension or compression.\nMethod of Sections may be used as an alternative to find forces BE and DE. To apply Method of Sections, we should cut through no more than 3 unknown members and draw a free body diagram with no more than 3 total unknowns. For this problem, make a cut through the truss that passes through members AB, BE, and DE.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce that cut is made, a choice needs to be made to draw an FBD for the intact part of the truss to the left of the cut or the intact part of the truss to the right of the cut  Either way, the external forces on the side would need to be shown on the FBD as well as the force of each member that was cut through.\nIf we chose the left side, there would be unknowns AB, BE, and DE, as well as unknown reactions Ax, Fx, and Fy. However, on the right side there are no unknown support reactions so the only unknowns are forces AB, BE, and DE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum M_B=-(12*5)+(DE*5)=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad D E=12{~kN} \\\\\n& \\sum F_y=BE-8-12=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad B E=20{~kN}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nOnce again, the forces are drawn on the FBD in the tensile direction, so the positive answers indicate the forces are indeed tensile.\nAnswer: DE = 12 kN (Tensile), BE = 20 kN (Tensile)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Internal reactions in continuous bodies\nInternal reactions also exist within a body or structure. These reactions are necessary to hold the body together and will vary from point to point in a body depending on the distribution of external loading. As shown in Figure 1.2, the reactions at any given point can be examined by making a cut at the point of interest in the body. One can think of any point within a body as acting as a fixed support for the rest of the body. That is, every point must potentially exert a force parallel to the cross section where the cut is made which is the shear force V, a force perpendicular to the cross section where the cut is made which is the normal force N, and a reaction moment where the cut is made which is the bending moment M. Moreover, as was discussed for internal pin reactions and the cut made for Method of Sections for trusses, the reactions at a cut will be equal and opposite on the two sides of the cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Cross-sections showing the internal loads on a continuous body\n\n\n\nTo determine the reactions, the FBD of the part of the beam to the left of the cut can be drawn and used, or the part of the beam to the right of the cut can be drawn and used. As was discussed with Method of Sections for trusses, the choice of which side of the cut to examine is based primarily on which side appears easiest and most efficient to analyze. Once the FBD of the cut section is drawn, the three equilibrium equations can be applied to determine the internal reactions. The determination of shear and bending moments in beams will be reviewed in more detail in Chapter 7. The focus of Example 1.5 is on the determination of the normal force, as this will be important in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.5  \n\n\nTwo solid bars make up the axial assembly loaded as shown. Determine the normal force in each bar. State whether the force is tensile or compressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the assembly is not a beam, determining the internal reactions will work in the same way. In this particular case, all the forces are in the normal direction (no shear force) and due to the central placement of the 60 kN force and the symmetry of the 125 kN forces, there will be also be no bending moment. Consequently, only the normal reaction force will be drawn on the FBDs.\nTo find the internal load in a segment, cut a cross-section within that segment. Since the external loading (and therefore the internal loading) changes at point B, we’ll make one cut in segment AB and another in segment BC.\nMaking the cut in section AB and drawing the FBD allows us to determine the normal force in section AB. Note that drawing the left section of the cut for the FBD results in avoiding needing to know the external reactions at wall C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sum F_x=-50{~kN}+N_{AB}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad N_{AB}=50{~kN}\n\\]\nMaking the cut in section BC and drawing the FBD allows us to determine the normal force in section BC. Once again, drawing the left section of the cut for the FBD results in avoiding needing to know the external reactions at wall C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sum F_x=-50{~kN}+180{~kN}+N_{BC}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad N_{BC}=-130{~kN}\n\\]\nFor both AB and BC, the internal normal force was assumed tensile in the FBD and equilibrium equation. In the case of NAB, the positive answer confirms that it is tensile. In the case of NBC, the negative answer reveals that it is compressive.\nAnswer: NAB = 50 kN (T), NBC = 130 kN (C)",

Each individual component represents the tendency of the body to rotate around the specified axis. In 3D, there are three internal forces and three internal moments (Figure 1.3). There is one normal force (Nx) perpendicular to the cross-section and two shear forces (Vy and Vz) parallel to the cross-section. There are two bending moments (My and Mz) which act around the axes parallel to the cross-section and one torsional moment (Tx) which acts around the axis perpendicular to the cross-section. We will study each of these loads in detail over the next few chapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: In 3D there are three internal forces (normal force Nx and two shear forces Vy and Vz) and three internal moments (torsional moment Tx and two bending moments My and Mz)\n\n\n\nNote that the choice of coordinate system here is arbitrary. Loads are defined as normal, shear, bending, or torsion based on how they act relative to the cross-section. For example, the normal force may act in the y-direction depending on how the cross-section is cut, and the torsional moment would then act around the y-axis.\nWhile summing the reaction forces in 3D is a straight-forward process of adding forces in each direction, summing moments in 3D can prove to be more complicated. To sum moments, there are generally two options. One option is to use the cross product to calculate moments: \\(M=r \\times F\\)\nIn the cross-product equation, r is the position vector from the point the moment is about to any point on the line of action of the force. Using the cross product to calculate moment will result in a vector expression for the moment equation that gives all three components at one time with the correct signs to indicate clockwise (negative) or counterclockwise (positive) rotation.\nThe second option to calculate moments is to perform scalar calculations in which the sum of the moments about the x, y, and z axis is calculated individually. To use this option, it might be helpful to recall:\n\nThe general scalar equation for moment is M = F*d, where d is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation at the point the moment is being taken about to anywhere on the line of action of the force. One can also use M = F r sin α where r is the distance from the point to any point on the force and α is the angle between the position vector r (that corresponds to the magnitude r used) and the force vector.\nForces do not cause moments about points they go through or axes they act through.\nForces do not cause moments about axes they are parallel to (i.e., Fx wouldn’t cause a moment around an x-axis no matter where the point is).\nWhen taking the moment about a point, the origin of the coordinate axes should be moved to that point for the purpose of determining the distance between the axis and the force.\n\nGiven all the reminders above, one can apply the following equations:\n\\(\\sum M_x= \\pm F_y * z \\pm F_z * y\\) where z and y are the respective distances from the x-axis at the point in question to Fy and Fz components of the force respectively.\n\\(\\sum M_y= \\pm F_x * z \\pm F_z * x\\) where z and x are the respective distances from the y-axis at the point in question to Fx and Fz components of the force respectively.\n\\(\\sum M_z= \\pm F_x * y \\pm F_y * x\\) where y and x are the respective distances from the z-axis at the point in question to the Fx and Fy components of the force respectively.\nThe ± is decided based on the right-hand rule (see text below for guidance) or visual inspection. When using visual inspection, the direction of rotation is judged by looking from the positive end of the axis towards the negative end. A counterclockwise rotation is considered to be positive and a clockwise rotation is considered to be negative.\nTo apply the right-hand rule:\n\nOrient your right hand so that the fingers are aligned with the moment arm with the palm at the point and the fingertips extending towards the force. The moment arm is the axis along which the perpendicular distance to the axis would be determined. For example, if finding Mx due to Fy, the moment arm is in the z direction.\nThe thumb is aligned with the axis of rotation (axis around which the moment is being calculated).\nCurl your fingers in the direction of the force. If your thumb must be pointed in the positive axis direction to perform this action, the moment is counterclockwise. If your thumb must be pointed in the negative axis direction, the moment is clockwise. Typical convention designates counterclockwise rotation to be positive and clockwise to be negative.\n\nThese concepts are further reviewed in Example 1.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.6  \n\n\nDetermine the internal reactions at point P, located at the center of the cross-section of the rectangular bar and 1.75 ft from the fixed support, if F = -150i - 225j + Fz = 300k lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the internal reactions at P, a cut is made at P that is parallel to the cross section. Since the left side of the cut would include the wall but the right side of the cut would be free with no external reactions to determine, the right side section will be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe force reactions at P will just be equal (but opposite in direction) to the force shown since there is only one. The moment reactions can be found by taking the moments about point P.\nThe moment about the x axis at point P is:\n\\[\n\\sum M_{Px} = \\pm ~F_yz \\pm F_zy = 0 = -[(225{~lb})(3{~in})(\\frac{1{~ft}}{12{~in}})]+[(300{~lb})(2{~in})(\\frac{1{~ft}}{12{~in}})]+M_{px} -6.25{~lb·ft}\n\\]\nThe moment about the y axis at point P is:\n\\[\n\\sum M_{Py} = \\pm ~F_xz \\pm F_zx = 0 = -[(150{~lb})(3{~in})(\\frac{1{~ft}}{12{~in}})]-[(300{~lb})(1.25{~ft})]+M_{py} -347.5{~lb·ft}\n\\]\nThe moment about the z axis at point P is:\n\\[\n\\sum M_{Pz} = \\pm F_xy \\pm F_yx = 0 = [(150{~lb})(2{~in})(\\frac{1{~ft}}{12{~in}})]-[(225{~lb})(1.25{~ft})]+M_{pz} -2.5{~lb·ft}\n\\]\nThe sign on the individual multiplicative terms in each equation are determined by right hand rule or visualization.\nAnswer:\nPx = 150 lb\nPy = 225 lb\nPz = 300 lb\nMPx = 6.25 lb·ft\nMPy = 348 lb·ft\nMPz = 2.5 lb·ft",

    "section": "2.1 Average Normal Stress",
    "text": "2.1 Average Normal Stress\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nAverage normal stress is defined as the internal normal force divided by the cross-sectional area of the body. It is given the Greek letter sigma (σ). Stress increases as the force increases or as the cross-sectional area decreases.\n\\[\n\\boxed\n{\\sigma=\\frac{N}{A}}\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nwhere\n𝜎 = Average normal stress [Pa, psi]\nN = Internal normal force [N, lb]\nA = Cross-sectional area [m2, in.2]\nAs such the SI units of stress are N/m2, more commonly referred to as the Pascal (Pa) where 1 Pa = 1 N/m2. The US customary units for stress are lb/in2, commonly written as psi. Since stresses can get very large, it is common to use prefixes such as kilo (k) and mega (M) to represent 103 and 106 respectively. A stress of 15,000,000 Pa is written as 15 MPa. A stress of 35,000 psi is written as 35 ksi.\nNormal stress occurs perpendicular to the cross-section and so is associated with either a pulling or pushing motion (Figure 2.1). Normal forces that pull on a cross-section are known as tensile forces and create a tensile normal stress. Normal forces that push on a cross-section are known as compressive forces and create a compressive normal stress. The normal stress calculated above is really an average normal stress as the force is distributed over the cross-section, but we generally simplify this to a concentrated force that creates the same normal stress at every point on the cross-section (Figure 2.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Forces pulling on a cross-section cause tension, while forces pushing on a cross-section cause compression. Both are very common. Left: A crane cable during a lift experiences tension. Right: The support columns under a bridge experience compression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: The internal load is equally distributed over the cross-sectional area, but may be represented as a single concentrated load acting at the center (N in this case). The stress is therefore an average normal stress.\n\n\n\nThe internal normal force in a body can be found through the method of equilibrium as reviewed in Section 1.2. See Example 2.1 for a demonstration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.1  \n\n\nThe support column will be subjected to a compressive force F = 65 kips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe diameter of the column is 4 inches. Determine the average normal stress in the column.\nThe column is to be made of concrete with an allowable compressive stress of 4 ksi. For the same force F = 65 kips, determine the required diameter of the column so that the average normal stress does not exceed 4 ksi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCut a cross-section through the column and draw a free body diagram. Although it is clear in this case that the internal load will be 65 kips, it is best to get in the habit of writing out equilibrium equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sum F_y= N-65{~kips}=0\n\\]\nThe column has a circular cross-section of area \\(A=\\pi(2)^2=4 \\pi{~in.}^2\\).\nThe average normal stress can now be found from:\n\\[\n\\sigma=\\frac{N}{A}=\\frac{65{~kips}}{4 \\pi{~in.}^2}=5.17{~ksi}\n\\]\n\nUse the average normal stress equation again, but this time the stress is known to be 4 ksi. The loading has not changed so the internal normal force will still be 65 kips.\n\n\\[\n\\sigma=\\frac{N}{A} \\rightarrow A=\\frac{N}{\\sigma}=\\frac{65{~kips}}{4{~ksi}}=16.25 {~in}^2\n\\]\nSince \\(A=\\pi r^2\\) we can find \\(r=\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{\\pi}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{16.25{~in.}^2}{\\pi}}=2.27{~in}\\).\nThen \\(d=2 r=2 * 2.27{~in.}=4.55{~in.}\\)\nNote that this is the minimum required diameter to ensure the average normal stress does not exceed 4 ksi. If the diameter is any smaller than this, the stress will exceed the 4 ksi limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes the loading or cross-sectional area of the body will change, resulting in a change in stress. In these cases the stress can be calculated separately in each segment of the body by first finding the internal load in each segment and then dividing the internal load by the cross-sectional area of the respective segment. Different parts of the body may experience different stresses. Generally the highest stress is of most importance as that is the stress that typically determines whether the body will break. Because we do not know in advance where the largest stress is, however, it is typically necessary to calculate the stress at each different cross-section in order to determine the highest stress. See Example 2.2 for a demonstration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.2  \n\n\nTwo hollow pipes are welded together as shown. Pipe (1) has an outer diameter of 70 mm and an inner diameter of 40 mm while pipe (2) has an outer diameter of 110 mm and an inner diameter of 60 mm. Forces are applied at the end of each pipe and at the weld, where F1 = 40 kN, F2 = 70 kN, and F3 = 30 kN. Determine the average normal stress in each pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can calculate average normal stress using \\(\\sigma=\\frac{N}{A}\\) so we will need to find the area of each pipe and the normal force in each pipe. This can be done in any order. Starting with the areas:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& A_1=\\pi\\left(0.035^2-0.02^2\\right)=0.00259{~m}^2 \\\\\n& A_2=\\pi\\left(0.055^2-0.03^2\\right)=0.00668{~m}^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe internal loads can be found by cutting a cross-section through each pipe, drawing a free body diagram, and writing an equilibrium equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\sum F_x=40{~kN}-N_1=0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad N_1=40{~kN} \\\\\n&\\sum F_x=40{~kN}-70{~kN}+N_2=0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad N_2=30{~kN}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that we may choose to draw the internal load in either tension or compression. The answer must be compared to the free body diagram. A positive answer from the equilibrium equation indicates that the direction drawn on the free body diagram was correct. Although both answers here were positive, it can be seen in the free body diagrams that N1 was drawn in compression and N2 was drawn in tension. These positive answers indicate that the drawings are correct. N1 is 40 kN in compression and N2 is 30 kN in tension.\nNote also that it is acceptable to draw a free body diagram of either side of the cross-section. This will not change the result. Perhaps it would have been easier to draw the right-hand-side of section 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sum F_x=30{~kN}+N_2=0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad N_2=30{~kN}\n\\]\nWe again find that N2 is 30 kN in tension. You may always choose to draw either side of a cross-section. Make sure to include everything to that side of your cut, all the way to the end of the structure (e.g. do not stop at the weld).\nNow that the areas and internal loads are known we can calculate the internal normal stresses.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\sigma_1=\\frac{N_1}{A_1}=\\frac{-40,000{~N}}{0.00259{~m}^2}=-15.4{~MPa} \\\\\n\\sigma_2=\\frac{N_2}{A_2}=\\frac{30,000{~N}}{0.00668{~m}^2}=4.49{~MPa}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Average Normal Stress\n\n\n\n\nUse equilibrium equations to determine reaction loads at any supports.\nCut a cross-section through the member at the point where you want to determine the internal normal stress, and draw a free body diagram of the member on either side of the cut. Be sure to include everything on the chosen side, including external loads, support reactions, and the internal normal force.\nUse equilibrium equations to determine the internal normal force (N) in the member.\nDetermine average normal stress using \\(\\sigma=\\frac{N}{A}\\).",

While normal forces (and therefore normal stresses) occur when a body is under tension or compression, shear forces (and therefore shear stresses) occur when a force is tangentially applied parallel to the cross-section, resulting in a sliding motion (Figure 2.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: (a) External loads F creating (b) an internal normal force (N) perpendicular to the cross-section. (c) External loads F1, F2, and F3 creating (d) an internal shear force (V) parallel to the cross-section. Note that for diagram (d) to be in equilibrium there would also need to be an internal bending moment. That has been omitted here for clarity.\n\n\n\nAlthough the basic definition of average normal stress and average shear stress is the same (force divided by area) there are some differences. To quickly differentiate which stress we are talking about, shear stress is denoted by the Greek letter tau (τ).\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\tau=\\frac{V}{A}}\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\nwhere\nτ = Average shear stress [Pa, psi]\nV = Internal shear force [N, lb]\nA = Cross-sectional area [m2, in.2]\nLike normal force, internal shear force can be found by cutting a cross-section through the body, drawing a free body diagram, and applying equilibrium equations. See Example 2.3 for a demonstration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.3  \n\n\nA bridge spans a gap of L = 150 ft. The roadway may be considered simply supported and has a rectangular cross-section of base b = 10 in. and height h = 6 in. It is subjected to a uniform distributed load of w = 200 lb/ft. Determine the magnitude of the average shear stress in the cross-section at x = 30 ft and x = 80 ft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage shear stress can be calculated from \\(\\tau=\\frac{V}{A}\\). The cross-sectional area is \\(A=10{~in.}*6{~in.}=60{~in.}^2\\)\nThe reactions at the support can be found by converting the distributed load into a statically equivalent concentrated load. This load will be equal to \\(F=200{~lb/ft}*150{~ft}=30000{~lb}\\) and will be located at the center of the bridge. Since the loading is symmetric, each support will support half of this load, or 15000 lb each.\nThe internal shear force can be found by cutting a cross-section through the point of interest, drawing a free body diagram, and applying equilibrium equations. Remember to include the internal loads V and M, and to again convert the distributed load into a statically equivalent concentrated load over this portion of the bridge.\nAt x = 30 ft:\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sum F_y=15,000{~lb}-6,000{~lb}-V=0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad V=9,000{~lb}\n\\]\nNote that an internal bending moment is also necessary in order to maintain equilibrium. We could find M by summing moments about any point, but it is not needed in order to solve this problem.\nThe shear stress can now be calculated.\n\\[\n\\tau=\\frac{V}{A}=\\frac{9,000{~lb}}{60{~in.}^2}=150{~psi}\n\\]\nAt x = 80 ft:\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sum F_y=15,000{~lb}-16,000{~lb}-V=0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad V=-1,000{~lb}\n\\]\nNote that the negative sign here simply indicates that V is acting in the opposite direction of that drawn in the free body diagram. It can be discarded here as we are calculating the magnitude of the average shear stress at each point.\n\\[\n\\tau=\\frac{V}{A}=\\frac{1,000{~lb}}{60{~in.}^2}=16.7{~psi}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShear stresses are common in both members of a structure and also in the fasteners between members. Depending on how these connections are formed we may see multiple shear planes. It is very important to correctly identify the internal force in the body. Figure 2.4 demonstrates the difference between single and double shear configurations for a pinned joint and the effects on internal shear force. See Example 2.4 for an example where double shear occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Pins experiencing (a) single shear and (b) double shear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.4  \n\n\nA pin made of a tin alloy with an allowable shear stress of 3 ksi is used to connect a footrest to the frame of a motorcycle. When in motion, the footrest supports a load of 200 lb which is transferred to the pin. Determine the required diameter of the pin such that the stress will not exceed 5 ksi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage shear stress can be calculated from \\(\\tau=\\frac{V}{A}\\). Rearrange this equation to \\(A=\\frac{V}{\\tau}\\). Start with a free body diagram of the pin in order to determine the internal shear force.\nFrom the diagram it should be apparent that the pin is in double shear and the maximum internal shear force in the pin is 100 lb. Thus the required cross-sectional area \\(A=\\frac{100{~lb}}{3000{~psi}}=0.0333{~in.}^2\\).\nSince \\(A=\\frac{\\pi}{4} d^2\\) the required diameter is \\(d=\\sqrt{\\frac{0.0333{~in.}^2 * 4}{\\pi}}=0.206{~in}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Average Shear stress\n\n\n\n\nUse equilibrium equations to determine reaction loads at any supports.\nCut a cross-section through the member at the point where you want to determine the internal shear stress, and draw a free body diagram of the member on either side of the cut.

    "text": "2.4 Stress on an Inclined Plane\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nWe have so far been cutting cross-sections perpendicular to the external force, or parallel to it. However, there is no rule that says we have to do this. It is perfectly acceptable to cut cross-sections at an angle and there are many situations where it may make sense to do so (Figure 2.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: (a) External loads, F, will create (b) an internal normal force, N, when a cross-section is cut vertically. (c) If the cross-section is cut along an inclined plane the internal force, P, will not be a normal force or shear force. (d) The internal force should be broken into normal (N) and shear (V) components that are perpendicular and parallel to the plane respectively.\n\n\n\nIn this scenario the internal load must still be equal and opposite to the external load in order to maintain equilibrium but, because we cut the cross-section at an angle, this internal load is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the cross-section. Therefore it is not entirely a normal force or a shear force. However, the internal force may be broken into components that are perpendicular and parallel to the cross-section.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& N=P \\sin (\\theta) \\\\\n& V=P \\cos (\\theta)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe area used to calculate the average normal and shear stresses must be the area of the inclined plane (Figure 2.8).

For a horizontal beam, area A is in the vertical plane so angle θ is measured from the horizontal axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: When calculating the stresses on an inclined plane, it is important to use the area of the plane, Ap, rather than the area of the cross-sectional plane, A.\n\n\n\nEven if the external load remains constant, we can obtain different values for the internal normal and shear forces (and therefore different values for the stresses) by changing the angle at which we cut the cross-section. We’ll explore the implications of this further in Chapter 12. For now, a demonstration of calculating the stresses on an inclined plane is given in Example 2.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.5  \n\n\nA beam is formed of two structural wooden members that are glued together along an inclined plane at angle θ = 40° and subjected to a tensile force of F = 30 kN.

It is the stress level (rather than just the load by itself) that determines whether an object will break under load. We can calculate the average normal stress and average shear stress acting on a body, though a complete understanding of the stress field within a complex object often requires more advanced concepts.\nStress depends on the internal load in the body, the cross-sectional area, and the orientation of the plane. Normal stress occurs when there is an internal normal force and may be tensile or compressive. Shear stress occurs when there is an internal shear force. Members may commonly experience multiple shear planes.\nIf there are multiple loads acting on a body, or if the body has multiple cross-sectional areas at different points, different parts of the body may experience different stresses. In such cases, we may calculate the stress in each part of the body by finding the internal load and cross-sectional area in that part of the body. In this chapter we have discussed average stress. In subsequent chapters further details on stress distributions will be discussed.\nBearing stress is similar to normal stress, but occurs between two bodies.\nWe may calculate stresses along inclined planes by cutting a cross-section at an angle.

If stresses get too large the object will break, so it is important that engineers design structures and machines such that the stresses stay within certain acceptable limits. It is also important that objects do not deform so much that they are no longer fit for their original purpose. Strain is a measure of the intensity of a deformation—that is, the deformation per unit length.\nImagine two points on a body, A and B separated by some distance L (Figure 3.1). In statics (and dynamics), objects are assumed to be rigid and they do not deform when subjected to forces. In reality, forces will cause an object to deform and its dimensions will change. As points A and B move with the object, the distance between them will change to some new distance L’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Nonrigid bodies will deform under load and the distance between any two points A and B will change as the body deforms.\n\n\n\nThese deformations may be very large relative to the size of the object (e.g., a rubber band) or they may be relatively small (e.g., structural members) but there will always be some amount of deformation as no material is infinitely stiff, as we will learn in Chapter 4. Engineers must design structures and machines such that these deformations are not excessively large for the intended application.\nThis chapter will introduce two types of strain.

    "text": "3.1 Normal Strain\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nA simple example of normal strain is the deformation of a bar subjected to an axial load. Consider a bar of length L subjected to a tensile axial load P as shown in Figure 3.2. The load will create a normal stress in the rod and will also cause the rod to elongate by an amount ΔL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Axial loads cause a change in length that depends partly on the original length of the object.\n\n\n\nIf the same load were applied to a longer rod of length 2L with the same cross-sectional area, the longer rod will elongate by an amount 2ΔL. The deformation depends on the original length of the rod in this case, but the strain does not. Strain is a measure that normalizes the change in length by the original length. Normal strain is defined as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nwhere\nε = Normal strain\nΔL = Change in length [mm, in]\nL = Original length [mm, in]\nThis is a normal strain because it occurs under axial load and is associated with a change in length of the object. Since normal strain is defined by dividing one length by another it does not have any units. However, it is fairly common to still include units of mm/mm or in/in.\nFor example, if the rod was initially 5 m long and it elongated by 12 mm, the normal strain can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}=\\frac{12}{5,000}=0.0024{~mm} /{mm}=0.0024\n\\]\nNote that the units used for ΔL and L must be the same, but it does not matter if they are expressed in mm or m. Using meters instead yields the same answer:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}=\\frac{0.012}{5}=0.0024{~m}/{m}=0.0024\n\\]\nBecause strains tend to be quite small in many engineering applications, they are sometimes expressed with a prefix to eliminate the leading zeros. For example, a strain of 0.0024 may be expressed as 2.4 mm/m or 2400 µm/m or simply 2400 µ. Strains may also be expressed as a percentage, which can be found simply by multiplying the strain by 100%. The below strains are all equivalent:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon=0.0024{~mm}/{mm}=0.0024{~m}/{m}=0.0024=2.4{~mm}/{m}=2400~\\mu{m}/{m}=2400 ~\\mu=0.24\\%\n\\]\nWe will continue to use the sign convention that we defined for normal stress. Tensile forces and stresses, which are associated with elongation of the bar and tensile normal strain, are positive. Compressive forces and stresses, which are associated with shortening of the bar and compressive normal strain, are negative (Figure 3.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: (A) Objects in tension will elongate. By convention, tension and elongation are positive. (B) Objects in compression will shorten. By convention, compression and shortening are negative.\n\n\n\nSee Example 3.1 for a problem involving a bar experiencing both tension and compression. Example 3.2 involves strain in two parallel cables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.1  \n\n\nThe bar is subjected to forces F1 = 30 kips and F2 = 10 kips as shown. Segment AB is originally 10 inches in length and segment BC is originally 15 inches in length. As a result of the applied forces, the normal strain in segment AB is – 0.03 in/in and the strain in segment BC is 0.045 in/in.\n\nDetermine the change in length of each segment\nDetermine the overall strain for the entire bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing \\(\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}\\) for each segment, rearrange to calculate the change in length of each segment.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta L_{A B}=\\varepsilon_{A B} L_{A B}=-0.03 * 10{~in.}=-0.3{~in.} \\\\\n& \\Delta L_{B C}=\\varepsilon_{B C} L_{B C}=0.045 * 15{~in.}=0.675{~in.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo find the overall strain for the entire bar, first find the overall change in length for the entire bar.\n\\[\n\\Delta L=-0.3{~in.}+0.675{~in.}=0.375{~in.}\n\\]\nOverall, the bar elongates by 0.375 in. The original length of the bar was 25 in. We can now determine the strain for the entire bar.\n\\[\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}=\\frac{0.375{~in.}}{25{~in.}}=0.015{~in./in.}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.2  \n\n\nRigid bar ABCD is supported by a pin at A and cables at B and D.

    "text": "3.2 Shear Strain\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nConsider a small, square element that may be part of a body such as that shown in Figure 3.1. As well as the distance between points changing as the body deforms, the shape of this square element will also change. The corners of the square element will initially form right-angles. As the body deforms and the points move with the object, the shape of the element changes and the corners no longer form right-angles (Figure 3.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: (A) The undeformed element is initially square, with right-angled corners. (B) As the body deforms, the square element skews and the corners are no longer right-angles.\n\n\n\nWhile normal strain represents a change in length, a shear strain represents a change in angle—a distortion of the shape. Specifically, provided we start with right-angled corners, shear strain is defined as the original angle (before deformation) minus the new angle (after deformation). Regardless of the shape of the body, a square element can always be defined such that the original angle is always a right angle. After deformation, the new angle between these three points is 𝜃’. Shear strain is given the symbol γ and is, like normal strain, a dimensionless quantity, so is represented in radians (not degrees). Thus the original right angle is represented as \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians and the shear strain as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\gamma=\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta^{\\prime}}\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nwhere\n𝛾 = Shear strain [rad]\n\\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) = Original angle [rad]\n𝜃’ = New angle [rad]\nSince we always subtract the new angle from the original angle, note that if the angle increases we get a negative shear strain and if the angle decreases we get a positive shear strain (Figure 3.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: (A) If the new angle 𝜃’ is larger than \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians, the shear strain is negative.

    "text": "Click to expand\n\nEngineering design of structures meant to carry load often involves the determination of geometries and sizes of the components involved that will be needed to meet the design requirements. Possible design criteria might be that the structure be capable of carrying anticipated loads without failure (e.g., an aircraft wing), that it be stiff enough to only deflect by a limited amount (e.g., a building girder), or that the material returns to its original configuration when the loading is removed (e.g., a 5 MPH bumper). Meeting these criteria requires us to understand the behavior of the material or materials that are being used within the structure. Exploring several of these basic mechanical properties is the focus of this chapter. An understanding of material behavior and these mechanical properties will enable us to relate stresses to strains, temperature change to strains, and explore the coupling that exists when subjecting materials to an arbitrary stress states.\nThe material properties described in this chapter will vary among materials. Material properties can be measured and recorded for reference in engineering handbooks. Some useful material properties for common engineering materials are recorded in Appendix C.\nFor the purposes of this book as we learn the principles, we assume that mechanical properties are constant, i.e. independent of temperature, rate of loading, etc.. This assumption works well for many engineering materials such as steel and aluminum at moderate temperatures, but temperature and rate dependence can be important at very high temperatures. Polymers, including plastics, rubber, etc. are known for their significant temperature and time or rate dependence, sometimes at common use temperatures, complicating the ability to tabulate these properties in a simple table. Practicing engineers often need to recognize and address such complications as they work with such materials.\nOf particular importance is that materials in this text are assumed to be isotropic—that is, they have the same properties when loaded in different directions. Anisotropic materials, which display different properties depending on the direction of loading, are quite common but are beyond the scope of this text.\nSection 4.1 discusses a common method of determining mechanical properties, known as the Tensile Test. The output of the Tensile Test - the Stress-Strain Diagram - is analyzed in Section 4.2.\nImportant mechanical relationships Hooke’s Law, which relates stress to strain, and Poisson’s ratio, which relates normal strain in the axial and lateral directions, are covered in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4.\nSection 4.5 considers the relationship between shear stress and shear strain and Section 4.6 introduces the concept of thermal strain. In Section 4.7 we expand Hooke’s Law from Section 4.3 to the general three-dimensional case.\nFinally, in Section 4.8, we consider applying a factor of safety to our designs to ensure they don’t fail.",

    "text": "4.1 Tensile Test\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nA common method of measuring mechanical properties of materials is the tensile test, which involves placing a cylinder or bar of material in a load frame (such as shown in Figure 4.1 (A)) and subjecting the specimen to tensile loading. These load frames are designed in such a manner that they can mechanically extend the tensile bar, often to failure, while measuring both the imposed load and the specimen deformation. These quantities for the specimen are then used to determine the local or material level behavior of stress and strain by using the relationships covered in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. These latter quantities are often essential in engineering design because properties from appropriate tests on laboratory specimens may be used to predict the behavior of much more complex engineering components.\nDuring a typical tensile test, a specimen (such as shown in Figure 4.1 (B)) is mounted in grips that are then separated at a prescribed displacement rate. To determine stress, the recorded force at any time is divided by the cross-sectional area of the specimen. Because of the likelihood of failures at the grip due to concentrations of stress, specimens are typically “waisted” to form dogbone or dumbbell shapes. Large fillets are used to reduce stress concentrations associated with the different areas (See Section 5.2), and failure will typically occur within the narrowed region of the specimen due to the smaller cross-sectional area. This region is often referred to as the “gage region” as this becomes the area of interest for the specimen. In addition, this specimen produces a uniform uniaxial stress state within this gage region of the specimen. The normal stress within this region is determined by:\n\\[\n\\sigma=\\frac{F}{A}\n\\]\nTo determine strain, devices such as mechanical extensometer’s (see Figure 4.1 (C)) are mounted on the specimen, measuring the deflection and dividing it by the original distance between the contact points.  The axial normal strain is determined by dividing the measured extension by the active length of the strain measuring device, typically a portion of the gage section of the specimen:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Tensile tests are a common means to measure mechanic properties of materials.

    "text": "4.2 Stress/Strain Diagram\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nThe goal in conducting tests of materials, such as the tensile test described above, is to learn qualitatively how the specimen responds and to quantitatively determine important mechanical properties of the material.\nAs discussed in the introduction to this chapter, these material properties will be assumed to be constant in this text and so, once determined from a test specimen, can be used to design and analyze components made of that same material. Appendix C contains material properties for a selection of these materials.\nFigure 4.2 (A) illustrates representative stress-strain behavior for several engineering materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Results obtained from tensile tests. (A) Illustration of a typical stress-strain behavior for some common materials. Temperatures denote anneal temperatures. (B) Tensile test of an AlMgSi alloy. This is a ductile fracture type, as seen by the local necking and the cup and cone fracture surfaces.\n\n\n\nEach material initially experiences a linear relationship between stress and strain, represented as a straight line on the stress/strain diagram. This linear portion is referred to as elastic deformation. One important property of elastic deformation is that if an object is loaded into the elastic region (causing a certain amount of stress and strain) and the load is subsequently removed, the object will return to its original dimensions.\nMaterials such as glass, silicon wafers, and concrete tend to be quite brittle, breaking prior to significant permanent or plastic deformation. The behavior remains nearly linear until failure, an attribute of brittle materials. On the other hand, certain copper alloys, mild steel, and many polymers are often quite ductile, meaning that there is considerable plastic deformation beyond some limiting value of stress or strain. Unless a material is perfectly brittle, there will be a certain point beyond which the relationship between stress and strain becomes nonlinear, represented by a curve departing from linear elastic behavior on the stress/strain diagram. This nonlinear (often curved) portion is referred to as plastic deformation. If an object is loaded into the plastic region and the load is subsequently removed, any plastic deformation is permanent, and the object will not return to its original dimensions.\nThe transition between the linear region of the stress-strain curve and the subsequent behavior marks an important engineering property of the material known as the yield stress. Although considerable variations are seen among different materials, yielding is typically defined as the region within which relatively small increases in stress are associated with relatively large increases in strain. The yield strength of the material is a very important design parameter, as many engineering components are designed to operate within the linear region of material response, and hence remain elastic, i.e., the ability to return to their original configuration when loading is removed. You likely have experienced material yielding if you have ever deformed a coat hanger or paperclip such that it does not return to the original state. Such behavior is undesirable for many engineering components designed to continue operating in their original state. On the other hand, plastic deformation following yielding can be very important in terms of the fabrication process. For example sheets of steel or aluminum can be placed between molds and compressed under high pressure to deform them into the shape of an automobile panel as seen in Figure 4.3 (A), an illustration of where plastic deformation is very important. Plastic deformation can also be useful in absorbing energy, such as seen in the concertina crushing of a structural component for an automobile (see Figure 4.3 (B)). This book, however, will focus on the pre-yield, linear elastic region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Engineering materials are often loaded beyond yield to permanently deform the material, as in (A) the stamping process for an automotive panel or in (B) the crushing of a weld-bonded hat section used to absorb energy in an automobile accident.\n\n\n\nSometimes the yield region is further described by three distinct points on the stress/strain curve. The proportional limit marks the point where the relationship between stress and strain stops being linear. The elastic limit marks the point beyond which materials do not return to their original state. The yield point is typically defined using the 0.2% offset method where a straight line beginning at a strain of 0.002 (0.2%) and running parallel to the linear portion of the diagram is drawn. The point where this line intersects the stress/strain curve is defined as the yield point. Since these three points for a material often occur within a fairly narrow range of one another, this text will refer to these three points collectively as yielding, and will define the stress at this point as the yield strength. Figure 4.4 illustrates these definitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Illustration of the proportional limit, the elastic limit, and the yield region of material response.\n\n\n\nOther metrics are also often quantitatively evaluated from stress-strain diagrams, including the ultimate strength, \\(\\sigma_{alt}\\), the maximum stress achieved prior to failure and the strain at break, \\(\\varepsilon_{break}\\) which is a measure of the ultimate elongation capabilities of the material (though is often dependent on the size of the specimen’s gage length.",

    "text": "4.3 Hooke’s Law\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nThe slope of the linear region of this stress/strain diagram represents an important material property known as Young’s modulus or the modulus of elasticity, which will be designated by E. The elastic modulus can be thought of as a measure of stiffness of the material. A high elastic modulus for ‘stiff’ materials is represented by a steep slope. That is, a large increase in stress with only a small increase in strain. A low elastic modulus for ‘soft’ materials is represented by a shallow slope indicating a small increase in stress but a large increase in strain.\nThomas Young (1773-1829) was a British scientist, who noted the proportionality between applied force and extension, which he recorded as “ut tensio sic vis”, meaning “as is the extension, so is the force”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Thomas Young\n\n\n\nThe linear elastic region of material response is of enormous importance for most engineering structures. Loading significantly beyond this proportional limit can result in pronounced yielding and permanent deformation that is often unacceptable, unless one is using this deformation to absorb energy (as in automobile frame involved in collision). Young’s modulus or the modulus of elasticity is illustrated in Figure 4.6 (A), which plots a portion of the normal stress versus normal strain, for example from a tensile test.\n\\[\nE=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon}\n\\]\nSince strain is unitless, elastic modulus will have the same units as stress [Pa or psi].\nThis relationship is more commonly called Hooke’s Law, and written in the form:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma=E \\varepsilon}\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nwhere\n𝜎 = Average normal stress [Pa, psi]\nE = Elastic modulus [Pa, psi]\n𝜀 = Normal strain\nIt is especially important to note that this relationship is only applicable within the linear elastic region of the material’s response. Use of this relationship beyond this region can lead to serious design mistakes. One should note that this proportionality, applicable at the material level for stress and strain, also extends to structural elements, such as bars in tension or compression, beam deflections, helical springs in which the force and deflection are related by the spring constant, and many other engineering components and structures, as will be covered in the following chapters of the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Illustration of the initial linear elastic portions of the sress strain curce and slopes corresponding to (a) Young’s modulus for uniaxial tension; (b) shear modulus for pure shear loading\n\n\n\nExample 4.1 uses Hooke’s law to determine the elastic modulus of a material where the applied load and deformation are known.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.1  \n\n\nTwo bars are welded together and fixed to a wall at A.

    "text": "4.4 Poisson’s Ratio\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nWhen you stretch a rubber band, you will note that the elastomer elongates in the axial direction but that the cross-sectional area contracts. That is, there is a normal strain in the longitudinal (length) direction and also in the lateral (width or thickness) direction. There is a coupling between these normal strains in perpendicular directions. Poisson’s ratio is the material property that describes the proportional relationship between longitudinal and lateral strains. Named after Siméon Denis Poisson (1781-1840), the French mathematician and physicist, Poisson’s ratio is defined as the negative of the lateral strain divided by the longitudinal strain for a uniaxial eight loaded material. It may be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\nu=-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{lateral}}{\\varepsilon_{longitudinal}}}\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nwhere\n𝜈 = Poisson’s ratio\n𝜀lateral = Lateral normal strain\n𝜀longitudinal = Longitudinal normal strain\nNote that this relationship is appropriate for a uniaxially loaded specimen (i.e., when a load is applied in only the longitudinal direction). Section 4.7 expands this relationship to cases where normal stresses are present in more than one direction. Poisson’s ratio is a material property that depends on the material as well as its structure. Theoretically, Poisson’s ratio can range from –1 to ½ for isotropic materials, but usually ranges from near zero for foams to nearly ½ for soft materials such as elastomers and gels. Most metals fall in the range from 0.2 to 0.35. A positive value of Poisson’s ratio means that as the material is extended in one direction, there will be a contraction in lateral directions. Most solid materials have positive Poisson’s ratios, though negative values have been reported in auxetic materials, such as certain meta-materials fabricated using additive manufacturing processes. Although beyond the scope of this course, such materials offer intriguing design possibilities. See Example 4.2 for a simple application of Poisson’s ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.2  \n\n\nA circular polymeric rod with a diameter of 10 mm is subjected to a uniaxial force, resulting in an axial strain of 0.5%.

    "text": "4.6 Thermal Strain\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nIn addition to relationships arising between stress and strain, other factors can affect dimensional changes of materials as well as changes in the stresses present in a structure. Most materials will expand, for example, when their temperature is increased. Many engineering structures will experience significant temperature variations during their life, beginning with thermal processes involved in their manufacture, cyclic temperature changes (e.g., day/night or summer/winter), or because of their usage, such as an engine block heating up or cooling down. Though dimensional changes from temperature often appear to be quite small, they can lead to significant changes in stress state, and in fact numerous failures result not from applied mechanical loading but from thermal exposure issues. Though beyond the current scope, other dimensional changes can also result from other environmental factors, such as the expansion of a material as water is absorbed, or from the application of electric fields for materials that exhibit piezoelectric properties.\nVibrational energy of atoms increases as temperature increases, typically leading to slightly greater atomic separation distances. This expansion leads to dimensional changes in the material, and the behavior is characterized by the material’s coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The linear CTE is often designated by \\(\\alpha\\) and is defined as the change in strain per unit change in temperature. As with the other material properties discussed in this chapter, \\(\\alpha\\) is assumed to be constant for any given material.\nThe CTE is independent of direction in isotropic materials.

    "text": "4.7 Multiaxial or Generalized Hooke’s Law\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nMaterials are often tested under idealized conditions, such as uniaxial tension or shearing resulting from torsional loading. These tests are important because they provide material properties necessary for engineering design. Such simple stress states are less common in actual engineered components, where more complex, multiaxial stress states are present, as shown in Figure 4.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Illustration of a general, multiaxial stress state, showing normal and shear stresses acting on the positive x-, y-, and z-planes. Note that equal and opposite stresses exist on the hidden faces of the element.\n\n\n\nHere there are three normal stresses, referred to with a single subscript indicating their direction (σx, σy, and σz). There are six shear stresses, designated by τ, which are referred to with two subscripts, one indicating the plane or ‘face’ that the stress acts on and the other indicating the direction that it acts in. For example, on the y-z plane (the x-face) there is the normal stress σx and two shear stresses, τxy and τxz. The first subscript indicates that these shear stresses act on the x-face and the second subscript indicates that they point in the y- and z-directions respectively.\nConsider the x-y plane of the stress element in Figure 4.7. This 2D plane is shown in Figure 4.8. It experiences two normal stresses (σx and σy) and two shear stresses (τxy and τyx). τxy will cause the element to rotate counterclockwise while τyx will cause the element to rotate clockwise. For an element in equilibrium, these two stresses must be equal in order for these rotation effects to balance. Expanding this to the other planes we may say τxy = τyx, τxz = τzx, and τyz = τzy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: 2D view of the x-y plane of a 3D stress element.\n\n\n\nHaving learned the concept of Poisson’s ratio, we recognize that there is a coupling between normal stresses in one direction and the normal strains in other directions. We have reviewed this in the context of the response to the application of a uniaxial stress state—a normal stress applied in only one direction. For example, if there is a normal stress in the x-direction there will also be a normal strain in the x-direction and also in the y- and z-directions.\nSpecifically:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon_x=\\frac{\\sigma_x}{E} \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_y=-v \\varepsilon_x=-\\frac{\\nu \\sigma_x}{E} \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_z=-\\nu \\varepsilon_x=-\\frac{\\nu \\sigma_x}{E}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nMost engineering structures, however, involve more complex stress states, in which stresses may be applied in the x-, y-, and z-directions. We refer to these as multiaxial stress states. We can define similar equations for a normal stress applied in the y-direction:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon_y=\\frac{\\sigma_y}{E} \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_x=-\\nu \\varepsilon_y=-\\frac{\\nu \\sigma_y}{E} \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_z=-\\nu \\varepsilon_y=-\\frac{\\nu \\sigma_y}{E}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAnd for a normal stress applied in the z-direction:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon_z=\\frac{\\sigma_z}{E} \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_x=-\\nu \\varepsilon_z=-\\frac{\\nu \\sigma_z}{E} \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_y=-\\nu \\varepsilon_z=-\\frac{\\nu \\sigma_z}{E}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf loads are applied in all 3 directions simultaneously, we can determine the overall strain in each direction by simply adding together the above components:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon_x=\\frac{\\sigma_x}{E}-\\frac{\\nu \\sigma_y}{E}-\\frac{\\nu \\sigma_z}{E}=\\frac{1}{E}\\left[\\sigma_x-\\nu\\left(\\sigma_y+\\sigma_z\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_y=\\frac{1}{E}\\left[\\sigma_y-\\nu\\left(\\sigma_x+\\sigma_z\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_z=\\frac{1}{E}\\left[\\sigma_z-\\nu\\left(\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\tag{4.7}\\]\nwhere\n𝜀x, 𝜀y, 𝜀z = Normal strain in the x-, y-, and z-directions\n𝜎x, 𝜎y, 𝜎z = Normal stress in the x-, y-, and z-directions [Pa, psi]\nE = Elastic modulus [Pa, psi]\n𝜈 = Poisson’s ratio\nThis is the generalized Hooke’s law for the 3-dimensional state of stress. Example 4.5 demonstrates the application of the generalized Hooke’s law to a problem with stresses acting in the x-, y-, and z-directions.\nWe may make similar observations about strain, where normal strains are written with a single subscript as εx, εy, and εz. Shear strains are written with 2 subscripts as γxy = γyx, γxz = γzx, and γyz = γzy.\nThe relationships between shear stresses and strains do not change in isotropic materials subjected to additional other stress components, so:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n& \\gamma_{xy}=\\frac{\\tau_{xy}}{G} \\\\\n& \\gamma_{yz}=\\frac{\\tau_{yz}}{G} \\\\\n& \\gamma_{xz}=\\frac{\\tau_{xz}}{G}\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\tag{4.8}\\]\nwhere\n𝛾xy, 𝛾yz, 𝛾xz = Shear strains\n𝜏xy, 𝜏yz, 𝜏xz = Shear stresses [Pa, psi]\nG = Shear modulus [Pa, psi]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.5  \n\n\nA solid, 50 mm polycarbonate cube is subjected to a compressive stress of \\(p=10 \\mathrm{MPa}\\) on all sides.

We can choose any one of the generalized Hooke’s law equations to determine the strain in the corresponding direction but note that all normal strains will be the same.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon_x=\\frac{1}{E}\\left[\\sigma_x-v\\left(\\sigma_y+\\sigma_z\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\varepsilon=\\frac{-p}{E}[1-2 v] \\\\\n& \\varepsilon=\\frac{-10 {~MPa}}{3{~GPa}}[1-2*0.38]=-~0.0008=-~0.08 \\%\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf one used the simple uniaxial Hooke’s law, \\(\\sigma=\\mathrm{E} \\varepsilon\\), one would erroneously obtain a strain of -0.33% and a change in length of –0.167 mm, more than four times the correct answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Multiaxial Hooke’s Law\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the stress, σ, acting on each side of the stress element\nUse these stresses to calculate the strain, ε, on each side of the stress element, using the generalized Hooke’s law\nCalculate the change in length of each side, using \\(\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}\\)",

    "text": "4.8 Allowable Stress/Safety Factor\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nSafety is of primary importance in engineering practice, and various engineering principles and codes are built on the necessity of considering the safety of products we design. The concept is that we would determine the location and magnitude of the maximum stresses under the most stringent anticipated loading conditions and compare these predicted values with the failure stress, such as the yield or ultimate strength of a material. Rather than allowing the maximum anticipated stress to equal the failure stress, however, products are often designed so that the maximum allowable stress is only some fraction of the failure stress, leading to a more conservative design. Essentially, the failure stress is scaled back by the factor of safety (F.S.), a quantity that is greater than one.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma_{allow}=\\frac{\\sigma_{fail}}{F . S .}}\n\\tag{4.9}\\]\nwhere\n𝜎allow = Allowable stress [Pa, psi]\n𝜎fail = Failure stress [Pa, psi]\nF.S. = Factor of safety\nExample problem 4.6 demonstrates a simple calculation of the factor of safety based on the failure and allowable stresses in a component. In practice it is also common to work the other way and, starting with a defined factor of safety and failure stress, calculate the allowable stress in a component made of a given material.\nMaking the factor of safety larger, in principle, should make the structure less likely to fail, but there are often weight, cost, environmental, and functional penalties associated with higher F.S. values. If the F.S. value is too small, the margin of safety for the design may become unacceptable. Unexpected overload situations, engineering design and assumption errors, and general wear and tear of a material over time, including in challenging environments, could lead to failure. The consequences of failures can range from minor inconveniences all the way to major catastrophes with significant loss of life and property. Negative publicity and attitudes towards even minor failures can be of concern to customers and significantly reduce future product sales, so product engineering involves risk assessment and mitigation, in addition to production costs and other factors.\nSafe design philosophies are often industry-specific and may be much more involved and complicated than our simple factor of safety concept conveys. For our purposes, suffice it to say that larger factors of safety are often used when there is less certainty about our designs, the loads our structures might sustain, or the severity of environmental and use conditions. Larger factors of safety are often required when the consequences of failure are considered to be greater. For example, design of a theatre that could be filled with hundreds of people might use a higher F.S. than that employed for a storage building that is seldom occupied. Example 4.6 demonstrates the use of factor of safety in a design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4.6  \n\n\nA 2 mm diameter steel wire is used to suspend a mass of 40 kg.

For many applications, the linear elastic properties are the first step in characterizing a material and in designing to determine stresses resulting from imposed displacements or strains and deflections caused by imposed loading scenarios.\nTensile tests of material samples are a common means to measure material behavior, both in the linear elastic region and beyond.\nTensile tests can provide the normal stress-strain behavior, and the Young’s modulus (or modulus of elasticity) is defined as the slope of the linear portion of this curve.\nThe proportional limit, elastic limit, and yield point of some engineering materials are quite similar, and the yield strength will be used throughout the book to denote this region of material response.\nBecause safe designs often involve materials being used below their yield strength, the linear elastic properties—moduli and Poisson’s ratio—are important parameters for engineering design.\nPoisson’s ratio characterizes the coupling between normal stresses in one direction and strains in lateral directions through the generalized Hooke’s law.\nThe shear modulus (or modulus of rigidity) relates shear stresses and shear strains in the linear elastic region.\nThe factor of safety is one simple means to quantify how conservative a design may be, an important parameter in engineering design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Equations\n\n\n\nHooke’s law:\n\\[\n\\sigma=E \\varepsilon_{long}\n\\]\nPoisson’s ratio:\n\\[\n\\nu=-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{lat}}{\\varepsilon_{long}}\n\\]\nShear stress/strain:\n\\[\n\\tau=G \\gamma\n\\]\nRelationship between E, G, and ν:\n\\[\nG=\\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}\n\\]\nThermal strain:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon=\\alpha \\Delta T\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta L=\\alpha\\Delta TL\n\\]\nGeneralized Hooke’s law:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\varepsilon_x=\\frac{1}{E}\\left[\\sigma_x-v\\left(\\sigma_y+\\sigma_z\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_y=\\frac{1}{E}\\left[\\sigma_y-v\\left(\\sigma_x+\\sigma_z\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& \\varepsilon_z=\\frac{1}{E}\\left[\\sigma_z-v\\left(\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n{\\begin{aligned}\n& \\gamma_{xy}=\\frac{\\tau_{xy}}{G} \\\\\n& \\gamma_{yz}=\\frac{\\tau_{yz}}{G} \\\\\n& \\gamma_{xz}=\\frac{\\tau_{xz}}{G}\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\] Factor of safety:\n\\[\nF .

We’ll extend this to a special case of axial deformation involving parallel bars in Section 5.4, before using our knowledge of axial deformation to help us solve statically indeterminate problems in Section 5.5.

    "section": "5.2 Stress Concentrations",
    "text": "5.2 Stress Concentrations\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nThe normal stress discussed in the previous section is averaged over the cross-section and assumes that stresses (and therefore strains) at the cross-section are uniform. In reality stresses and strains can vary across a cross-section, especially if the cross-section is close to an applied load, a support, or a change in geometry. At these points localized stress concentrations occur, leading to large, localized stresses and strains. The intensity of these concentrations depends on the type of loading, support, or geometry (Figure 5.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Each bar has a fixed support on the left, a cross-section of 30 in.², and is subjected to a force of 10,000 lb. The top bar is uniform and experiences a uniform average normal stress of $\\sigma=\\frac{10000}{30}=333$ psi at all points, except those close to the support and load. The bottom bar experiences the same stress at most points, but significantly higher stress concentrations close to the hole.\n\n\n\nHowever, these effects disappear a certain distance away from the force, support, or local geometry. It is therefore acceptable to assume uniform stress and strain (as we have been so far) provided that we also assume our cross-section is a sufficient distance away from these points. This is known as Saint-Venant’s principle, which can be formally stated as “The stresses and strains created at a point in a body by two statically equivalent loads are equivalent at points sufficiently far removed from the applied load” (Figure 5.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Two statically equivalent loads applied to a bar. Close to the point of application there will be localized stresses and deformations, but at a cross-section sufficiently far away from the applied loads the internal effects are equivalent.\n\n\n\nMore advanced courses will use the theory of elasticity to study the areas of variable stress and strain, but for now we’ll continue to apply Saint-Venant’s principle and assume that our cross-sections are sufficiently far away from the applied loads that we don’t need to consider these stress concentrations. We will however address the question of stress concentrations around changes in geometry here. We’ll study two specific examples; holes and fillets. Figure 5.2 shows an example of the stress concentrations around a hole. Figure 5.4 shows an example of the stress concentrations around a fillet. A fillet is a rounded corner used to help transition between two geometries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: The fillet helps prevent a sharp corner but still causes stress concentrations. The bar has a thickness of 3 in. The height of the smaller section is 6 in. and the larger section is 10 in. The applied load is 10,000 kips, so the average normal stress in the smaller section is 556 psi and in the larger section is 333 psi. The maximum stress at the fillet however is 973 psi.\n\n\n\nFully modeling these stress concentrations is very complicated, but for our purposes it is sufficient to find only the maximum stress that occurs around these stress concentrations. These can be significantly larger than the average stress we have been calculating, and can cause localized failure even if the average stress is below the yield stress for the material. The maximum stress can be found simply by multiplying the average stress by a stress concentration factor, K.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma_{max}=K \\sigma_{avg}}\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\nwhere\n𝜎max = Maximum normal stress [Pa, psi]\nK = Stress concentrtion factor\n𝜎avg = Average normal stress [Pa, psi]\nThis stress concentration factor depends on the geometry at hand and can be found from curves in design handbooks (Figure 5.5). See Example 5.1 and Example 5.2 to see how these curves can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Graphs showing how the stress concentration factor, K changes based on the geometry of the object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.1  \n\n\nA hole is drilled through a steel plate to allow two components to be bolted together.

The cross-sectional area may change at different points along the bar, or perhaps there could be different materials with different elastic moduli connected in series to form the bar. In any of these cases we can split the bar into sections where each section has a constant F, A, and E. We can calculate the change in length of each section separately and sum them to find the total.

The first segment covers the 9-inch steel rod. After the first 9 inches of the component, both the cross-sectional area and elastic modulus change so a second segment is needed. This segment covers the next 4 inches.

    "text": "5.4 Deformation in Series of Bars\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nSometimes a structure will have more than one axially loaded member. In such cases there are multiple bars that will experience a change in length and the amount of deformation won’t necessarily be the same in each member. The deformable members are generally connected by a rigid (nondeformable) beam. These problems generally involve a little geometry alongside our deformation equation (Figure 5.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Rigid beam AB is attached to deformable poles 1 and 2. The poles may deform different amounts so point A is displaced by amount ΔL1, point B by amount ΔL2, and point C by an amount in between these two values.\n\n\n\nBy identifying the force in each member through equilibrium, we may calculate the deformation of each member separately using:\n\\[\n\\Delta L=\\frac{F L}{A E}\n\\]\nOnce the change in length of each member is known, we can find the displacement at different points on the rigid beam through simple geometry of the rigid beam (Figure 5.8).

    "section": "5.5 Statically Indeterminate Problems",
    "text": "5.5 Statically Indeterminate Problems\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nA statically indeterminate problem is one which has more unknowns than we have equilibrium equations to solve for those unknowns. This is an issue because it prevents us from finding the internal loads and we therefore can’t calculate stress or deformation.\nWe’ll study two types of statically indeterminate problems. In the first type there will be additional supports beyond those needed to maintain equilibrium. These are known as redundant supports and they are quite common in practice (Figure 5.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: An example of redundancy on a suspension bridge. There are multiple supports and multiple cables at each support, such that if one cable fails the entire structure does not collapse.\n\n\n\nIn such problems, it is not possible to determine all of the reaction forces using equilibrium alone. However, we can use our knowledge of deformation to help. If a member is held between two supports then its total deformation must be zero. Since the change in length depends on the internal force in the member, this introduces an additional equation to use alongside the equilibrium equations. There are two possible approaches here.\nApproach 1: To determine the reaction force at the redundant support, begin by removing the redundant support from the problem and determining the deformation that would occur if the support was not there. Then replace the reaction force at the support, which will cause the member to deform in the opposite direction (Figure 5.11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.11: (a) A bar held between two rigid supports. (b) A free body diagram of the beam reveals that there are two unknowns but only one equilibrium equation. (c) Removing one of the supports allows the bar to elongate. (d) Replacing the support force causes the bar to contract.\n\n\n\nThe sum of these two deformations must equal the actual deformation of the member. If the member is held between two rigid supports, the total deformation will be zero. If there is a small gap or the supports allow a certain amount of movement, the total deformation will be equal to the size of this gap. Example 5.5 shows this process applied to a bar made of 2 materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.5  \n\n\nA 15-foot-tall concrete (E = 4,000 ksi) column has a square cross-section of 6 in. by 6 in. A 10-foot-tall-copper (E = 17,000 ksi) cylinder with an outer diameter of 4 in. and in inner diameter of 3 in. is attached to the top of the concrete. The structure is fixed between two supports. A force of 25 kips is applied as shown. Determine the average normal stress in each material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the internal force in each material, we first need to find the reaction forces at the supports. We would usually draw a free body diagram and apply equilibrium equations to find these forces. However, this won’t work here because the problem is statically indeterminate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sum F_y=F_1+F_2-25{~kips}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad F_1+F_2=25{~kips}\n\\]\nTo solve the statically indeterminate problem, remove one of the supports and allow the structure to deform. Either support may be removed. Let’s remove the top support. In this scenario there is no load in the copper cylinder and there is a compressive load of 25 kips in the concrete column.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total deformation of the structure in this scenario is:\n\\[\n\\Delta L=\\sum \\frac{F L}{A E}=0-\\frac{(25{~kips}) *(15 * 12){~in.}}{(6 * 6){~in.}^2 *(4,000)\\frac{kips}{in.^2}}=-0.03125{~in}\n\\]\nThen replace force F1 and calculate the deformation caused by this force. Since the force is applied at the top of the structure, both the concrete and the copper will elongate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\Delta L=\\sum \\frac{F L}{A E}=\\frac{F_1 *(10 * 12){~in.}}{\\pi(2^2-1.5^2){~in.}^2 *(17,000)\\frac{kips}{in.^2}}+\\frac{\\left(F_1\\right) *(15 * 12){~in.}}{(6 * 6){~in.}^2 *(4,000)\\frac{kips}{in.^2}} \\\\\n=0.001284F_1+0.00125 F_1 \\\\\n=0.002534 F_1\n\\]\nSince the structure is fixed at both ends, the actual total deformation must be zero.\n\\[\n-0.03125{~in.}+0.002534 F_1=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad F_1=12.3{~kips}\n\\]\nReturning to our equilibrium equation, we can also find force F2.\n\\[\nF_1+F_2=25{~kips} \\\\\n12.3{~kips}+F_2=25{~kips} \\\\\nF_2=12.7{~kips}\n\\]\nThe internal force in the copper cylinder will be 12.3 kips and the internal force in the concrete column will be 12.7 kips. Finally, calculate the stress in each material. Note from our original free body diagram that the copper cylinder is in tension while the concrete column is in compression. We’ll introduce a negative sign here to indicate compressive stress in the concrete.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sigma_{copper}=\\frac{N_1}{A_1}=\\frac{12.3{~kips}}{\\pi(2^2-1.5^2){~in.}^2}=2.24 {~ksi} \\\\\n& \\sigma_{concrete}=-\\frac{N_2}{A_2}=-\\frac{12.7{~kips}}{(6 * 6){~in.}^2}=-0.353 {~ksi}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproach 2: An alternate approach is to start by noting that the total deformation of the bar must be zero. In the case shown in Figure 5.12, we can say that the deformation of segment 1 plus the deformation of segment 2 must add up to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.12: (a) A bar held between two rigid supports. (b) A free body diagram of the bar.\n\n\n\nThe internal load in segment 1 is FA and the internal load in segment 2 is FB, so there are currently two unknowns. We may use an equilibrium equation to solve for these two unknowns simultaneously.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} & \\frac{F_A L_1}{A_1 E_1}+\\frac{F_B L_2}{A_2 E_2}=0 \\\\\n\\\\\n& F-F_A-F_B=0\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nExample 5.6 re-solves Example 5.5 using this method instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.6  \n\n\nA 15-foot-tall concrete (E = 4,000 ksi) column has a square cross-section of 6 in. by 6 in. A 10-foot-tall-copper (E = 17,000 ksi) cylinder with an outer diameter of 4 in. and in inner diameter of 3 in. is attached to the top of the concrete. The structure is fixed between two supports. A force of 25 kips is applied as shown. Determine the average normal stress in each material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAs before, begin with an equilibrium equation that relates the support loads to the applied load. In this equation we use the convention that forces pointing upwards are positive and forces pointing downwards are negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum F_y=F_1+F_2-25{~kips}=0 \\\\\n& F_1+F_2=25{~kips}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis bar consists of 2 segments – the copper cylinder (segment 1) and the concrete column (segment 2). Since the bar is held between two rigid supports, the total deformation of these two segments must sum to zero. Note that in this diagram segment 1 is in tension while segment 2 is in compression. We must be consistent with the sign convention that tension is positive and compression is negative.\n\\[\n\\frac{F_1 L_1}{A_1 E_1}-\\frac{F_2 L_2}{A_2 E_2}=0\n\\]\nHere F1 and F2 are the internal forces in segments 1 and 2 of the bar. These will be the same as the reaction loads at the supports that we are trying to solve for.\n\\[\n\\frac{F_1 *(10 * 12){~in.}}{\\pi(2^2-1.5^2){~in.}^2 *(17,000)\\frac{kips}{in.^2}}-\\frac{F_2 *(15 * 12){~in.}}{(6 * 6){~in.}^2 *(4,000)\\frac{kips}{in.^2}}=0\n\\]\nRearrange the equilibrium equation and substitute into the deformation equation.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nF_1=25{~kips}-F_2 \\\\\n\\frac{(25-F_2){~kips} *(10 * 12){~in.}}{\\pi(2^2-1.5^2){~in.}^2 *(17,000)\\frac{kips}{in.^2}}-\\frac{F_2 *(15 * 12){in.}}{(6 * 6){in.}^2 *(4,000)\\frac{kips}{in.^2}}=0\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nThen simplify and solve for force F2.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n0.0321-0.001284 F_2-0.00125 F_2=0 \\\\\n0.0321=0.002534 F_2 \\\\\nF_2=12.7 {~kips}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nThen use the equilibrium equation again to find F1.\n\\[\nF_1=25{~kips}-12.7{~kips}=12.3{~kips}\n\\]\nThese are the same reactions that we found in Example 5.5 when we solved this problem using the other approach. From here we can find the stress in each material as before, noting again from our diagram that segment 2 is in compression.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sigma_{copper}=\\frac{N_1}{A_1}=\\frac{12.3{~kips}}{\\pi(2^2-1.5^2){~in.}^2}=2.24 {~ksi} \\\\\n& \\sigma_{concrete}=-\\frac{N_2}{A_2}=-\\frac{12.7{~kips}}{(6 * 6){~in.}^2}=-0.353 {~ksi}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second type of indeterminate problem involves two materials bonded together in parallel. In these problems it’s possible to find the reactions at the supports, but not possible to find the internal force in each material using only equilibrium (Figure 5.13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.13: When two materials in parallel are subjected to force F, the force is split between the two materials (F1 and F2). By equilibrium F1 + F2 = F but this is not sufficient to find the force in each material.\n\n\n\nWe have one equilibrium equation but two unknown internal forces. However, since the materials are bonded together we can say that they must deform by the same amount. By setting the deformation for each material equal to each other we can define a second equation that involves the two internal forces and, combined with the equilibrium equation, we can now solve for both internal forces. See Example 5.7 for a demonstration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.7  \n\n\nA 20-ft-tall concrete (E = 4,000 ksi) column has a square cross-section 6 inches on each side. It is reinforced by six pieces of steel (E = 30,000 ksi) rebar that extend through the length of the column. Each has a diameter of 0.5 inches. The column is subjected to a compressive load of 70 kips. Determine the stress in each material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 70 kips force will be split between the two materials. We need to find the force in each material before we can calculate the stress. Start by cutting a cross-section through the column, drawing a free body diagram, and writing an equilibrium equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sum F_y= F_C+F_S=70{~kips}\n\\]\nThis problem is statically indeterminate, since we have two unknowns and only one equilibrium equation. However, since the two materials are bonded together we can say that they must both deform the same amount.\n\\[\n\\Delta L_C=\\Delta L_S\n\\]\nSince we know \\(\\Delta L=\\frac{F L}{A E}\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{F_C L_C}{A_C E_C}=\\frac{F_S L_S}{A_S E_S}\n\\]\nThe length of both materials is 20 ft, so this term will cancel.\nAlthough the steel is 6 individual pieces, it’s fine to determine the total area of the steel and the total force in the steel. The total area of the steel is \\(A_S=6 * \\pi * (0.25{~in.})^2=1.178{~in}^2\\)\nFor the area of the concrete, calculate the area of the square and then remove the area of the 6 rebar rods.\n\\[\nA_C=(6 * 6){~in.}^2-1.178{~in.^2}=34.82{~in.}^2\n\\]\nSubstitute these into the deformation equation and rearrange.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{F_C}{34.82{~in.}^2 * 4,000{~ksi}}=\\frac{F_S}{1.178{~in.}^2 * 30,000{~ksi}} \\\\\nF_C=F_S\\left[\\frac{34.82{~in.}^2 * 4,000{~ksi}}{1.178{~in.}^2 * 30,000{~ksi}}\\right] \\\\\nF_C=3.941 F_S\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nSubstitute this into the equilibrium equation.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&F_C+F_S=70{~kips} \\\\\n&3.941 F_S+F_S=70{~kips} \\\\\n&4.941 F_S=70{~kips} \\\\\n&F_S=14.2{~kips}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen since \\(F_C=3.941 F_S \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad F_C=3.941 * 14.2{~kips}=55.8{~kips}\\)\nNow that we know the force in each material, we can calculate the stress in each material.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sigma_S=\\frac{14.2{~kips}}{1.178{~in.}^2}=12.0{~ksi} \\\\\n& \\sigma_C=\\frac{55.8{~kips}}{34.82{~in.}^2}=1.60{~ksi}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Statically indeterminate axial problems\n\n\n\nProblems with redundant supports\nApproach 1:\n\nWrite out equilibrium equations.

Note that for a given change in temperature, the thermal strain will be the same in the axial and transverse directions.\nSince strain is also defined as \\(\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}\\), we can also predict the deformation due to a change in temperature:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_T=\\alpha \\Delta T=\\frac{\\Delta L}{L} \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad \\Delta L=\\alpha \\Delta T L\n\\]\nIf the object is free to expand or contract this doesn’t cause any issues and is easy to account for. Many real applications will include a small gap to allow for changes in length due to temperature changes (Figure 5.14). It is even possible that an object is subjected to both a physical force and a temperature change and the total change in length is simply the sum of these effects:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Delta L=\\Delta L_F+\\Delta L_T=\\frac{F L}{A E}+\\alpha \\Delta T L}\n\\tag{5.3}\\]\nwhere\n𝛥L = Change in length [m, in.]\n𝛥LF = Change in length due to applied load [m, in.]\n𝛥LT = Change in length due to temperature change [m, in.]\nF = Internal force [N, lb]\nL = Original length [m, in.]\nA = Original cross-sectional area [m2, in.2]\nE = Elastic modulus [Pa, psi]\n𝛼 = Coefficient of thermal expansion \\(\\left[\\frac{1}{^\\circ C}, \\frac{1}{^\\circ F}\\right]\\)\n𝛥T = Change in temperature \\([^\\circ C, ^\\circ F]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.14: Expansion joint on a bridge, allowing for thermal expansion and contraction of the bridge as temperature changes through the year.\n\n\n\nHowever if we do not design a gap, or if the gap is not large enough, then the object is not free to expand or contract. As the member pushes or pulls on its supports, a physical force is created. This in turn creates a stress in the object and these stresses can be very large. Such problems are statically indeterminate as the force applied on the member by the support is unknown and can’t be found using only equilibrium. Solving these problems is very similar to solving the first type of statically indeterminate problem. First, remove a support and determine the amount of deformation that would occur due to the change in temperature if the object were free to deform. Then replace the force from the removed support, which will cause the object to deform in the other direction. The sum of these two deformations will equal the total deformation of the member as before. Example 5.8 works through an indeterminate thermal expansion problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5.8 Steel (E = 200 GPa, α = 11.7 x 10-6 /°C) train rails are laid end-to-end. Each rail is 20 meters long. A small section of this track is shown below. The rails are laid in winter when the temperature is 0° C. In summer, the maximum temperature is 40°C. Determine the compressive stress in the rail as a result of the temperature change if:\n(a) In a particular section of track, the rails are laid with no gap between them.\n(b) In another section, the rails have a 5-mm-gap between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\nFirst determine the deformation of each rail that would occur if it was free to expand.\n\\[\n\\Delta L_T=\\alpha \\Delta T L=11.7 \\times 10^{-6}/^\\circ{C} * 40^\\circ{C} * 20{~m}=0.00936{~m}\n\\]\nSince each rail will contact the rail next to it as it tries to expand, each rail will experience a compressive force. This force causes compression in the rail.\n\\[\n\\Delta L=-\\frac{F L}{A E}\n\\]\nThe actual deformation of each rail must be zero since they are in contact end-to-end. Thus, these deformations must sum to zero.\n\\[\n0.00936{~m}-\\frac{F * 20{~m}}{A * 200 * 10^9{~Pa}}=0\n\\]\nAlthough we don’t know the cross-sectional area of the rail, we can replace \\(\\sigma=\\frac{F}{A}\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n0.00936{~m}-\\sigma * \\frac{20{~m}}{200 * 10^9{~Pa}}=0 \\\\\n\\sigma=\\frac{0.00936{~m} * 200 * 10^9{~Pa}}{20{~m}}=93.6{~MPa}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n(b)\nIn this case we again begin by determining the deformation of each rail that would occur if it was free to expand.\n\\[\n\\Delta L_T=\\alpha \\Delta T L=11.7 \\times 10^{-6}/^\\circ{C} * 40^\\circ{C} * 20{~m}=0.00936{~m}\n\\]\nEach rail would expand 9.36 mm, but the gap between rails is only 5 mm so the rails close this gap and make contact, which means there will again be some compressive stress. Set up the deformation equation as in part (a), but this time the deformation is 5 mm (0.005 m) instead of zero.\n\\[\n0.00936{~m}-\\frac{F * 20{~m}}{A * 200 * 10^9{~Pa}}=0.005{~m}\n\\]\nReplace \\(\\sigma=\\frac{F}{A}\\) as before and determine the stress.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n0.00936{~m}-\\sigma * \\frac{20{~m}}{200 * 10^9{~Pa}}=0.005{~m} \\\\\n0.00936{~m}-0.005{~m}=\\sigma * \\frac{20{~m}}{200 * 10^9{~Pa}} \\\\\n\\sigma=\\frac{0.00436{~m} * 200 * 10^9{~Pa}}{20{~m}}=43.6{~MPa}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nWe can see that installing the rails with a small gap has significantly reduced the thermal stress. Accurately predicting the amount of deformation and leaving a suitably sized gap would reduce the stress even further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Thermal deformation\n\n\n\n\nRemove one of the supports and calculate the total deformation that would occur if the support wasn’t there using \\(\\Delta L_T=\\alpha \\Delta T L\\) for thermal deformation and \\(\\Delta L=\\frac{F L}{A E}\\) for any applied axial loads.\nIf the total deformation causes the member to contact a support that prevents some of the deformation, replace the force from the removed support and determine the deformation caused by this force in terms of the force itself using \\(\\Delta L=\\frac{F L}{A E}\\).\nSum these deformations and set them equal to the total allowed deformation. Use this equation to solve for the force at the redundant support.\nUse equilibrium to determine the force at any other supports.",

    "text": "Click to expand\n\nTorsion is a moment applied around the longitudinal axis of a body. The effect of torsion is a twisting action. Torsion is found in many common situations. Some examples of applications in which torsion is a primary form of loading include:\n\nIn machinery, rotating shafts, such as transmission shafts that transmit power, are subjected to torque\nWhen one uses a torque wrench to tight or loosen a bolt, the bolt is subjected to torque\nPoles on which road signs and traffic lights are mounted are subjected to torque when forces (such as wind) are applied perpendicular to the sign (Figure 6.1).\nHinge pins are subjected to torque when the rotating elements they are attached to (doors for example) are rotated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Horizontal wind blowing on the traffic lights will create a torsional moment in the vertical pole.\n\n\n\nThis chapter will focus on bodies subjected to pure torsion (no axial or bending loads). These concepts will appear again in Chapter 14 when more generalized loading conditions are discussed.\nIn Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 we’ll derive equations for calculating the stress and deformation caused by torsional loads. In Section 6.3 we’ll consider statically indeterminate torsion problems, using methods similar to those in Section 5.5. In Section 6.4 we’ll consider torques due to power transmission, a common application where torques are present.\n\n6.0.1 The Effect of Torsion\nAs mentioned above, the effect of a torsional moment is to cause the body to twist. The resulting stress is a shear stress.\nConsider the pleated tube shown in Figure 6.2 below. @fig6.2 (A) shows the tube in an unloaded state with some of the pleats colored for identification. In Figure 6.2 (B), we see that after a torque is applied, the pleats move vertically but not horizontally. In addition, without the color present, it would be difficult to identify the displacement at all. We can say that all points remain in their original plane even in the deformed state so that the shape of the cross-section is unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Unloaded tube (left) and tube with torque applied (right).\n\n\n\nNow consider the I-beam subjected to torsion in Figure 6.3. In this case we see that the shape of the cross-section changes and that the points do not remain in the same vertical plane (there is horizontal displacement as well as vertical). This shape change is referred to as warping. In this text, we will only be considering circular cross-sections with no warping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: I-beam subjected to torsion unloaded (a) and with applied torque (b).\n\n\n\nGoing back to Figure 6.2, let’s consider the shape formed by the non-displaced colored lines in Figure 6.2 (A) versus the displaced lines in Figure 6.2 (B). These images are shown again in Figure 6.4. In the non-displaced case, a rectangle can be drawn around the green lines on the left with 90° corners. In the displaced case, the corners are no longer at 90°. From Section 3.2, we know that this change in angle is the definition of shear strain. The evidence of shear strain indicates that the applied torque results in shear stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Evidence of shear strain\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0.2 Determination of Internal Torques\nAs with axial loading, the stress and deformations due to torsion vary from point to point within a body and are dependent on the internal torques at the individual points and geometric section properties. Internal torques can be found by sectioning bodies and applying equilibrium equations, just like we did axial loading problems (see examples 1.5, 2.1 and 2.2). In the case of internal torques, moment equilibrium around the longitudinal axis will be applied instead of force summation.\nBefore looking at an example that illustrates the process of finding internal torque reactions, it would be beneficial to establish the sign conventions that will be used as well as ways of representing torque in this text.\n\n\n6.0.3 Sign Convention and Representation of Torque\nJust as is typically used for moments, the sign convention that will be used in this text for torques is to assign a positive sign to torques that are counterclockwise and a negative sign for those that are clockwise. However, the direction that a torque appears to be depends on the perspective from which the rotation is being observed. In Figure 6.5 below, the applied torque would appear clockwise if viewed from the left end of the bar towards the right and counterclockwise if viewed from the right end of the bar towards the left. As long as one is being consistent, it is not usually important which perspective is used. However, a typical convention is to look from the free end of the shaft if there is one, towards the fixed end, or from the positive longitudinal axis if one is given, towards the negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Different directions for viewing torque result in different perspectives on sign.\n\n\n\nIt can sometimes be difficult to visually determine whether a torque appears clockwise or counterclockwise, so one tool that can be used is the right-hand rule. If you use your right hand and curl your fingers in the direction of the rotation represented by the torque arrow, a positive (counterclockwise) torque would be represented if your thumb points in the direction of the positive longitudinal axis (the x-axis in Figure 6.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Using the right-hand rule to determine sign for torque\n\n\n\nWhen examining cut sections as will be needed to determine internal torques, establishing the sign of the internal torque requires looking from the direction of the cut edge towards the end of the cut section. One tool that can be used in this instance in place of direction visualization is to make the cut necessary to determine the internal torque in a given section and then imagine your right hand as being at the cut edge and curl your fingers in the direction of the torque. If your thumb points away from the cut edge, the internal torque is positive and vice versa. This is illustrated in Figure 6.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Tool to determine sign of internal torques\n\n\n\nFinally, since circular arrows can be difficult to draw in a way that clearly conveys direction, double headed line arrows are frequently used to represent torque. Conventions can vary between texts and other sources. In this text, the following convention will be used:\n\nOn a whole body FBD, arrows facing in the direction of the positive longitudinal axis will be considered to indicate positive torques (counterclockwise) and vice versa. When applying equilibrium, these signs will be used.\nThe same will hold true for cut section FBD’s used to determine internal torques. However, if applying equilibrium indicates that the internal torque points away from the cut section, the torque can be concluded to be positive (counterclockwise) for the purposes of calculating angle of twist. Internal torque that points towards the cut section can be concluded to be negative (clockwise). In addition, on the cut sections, the regular convention of right directed arrows being positive and left directed arrows being negative for the purpose of summing moments will be used.\n\nThe direction of the internal torque is not important in calculating shear stress (the sign on the stress requires concepts that will be discussed in Chapter 12), but it is important when calculating angle of twist, as we’ll see in Section 6.2.\nExample 6.1 demonstrates how to determine internal torques in a multi-section body as well as how to apply the above-described sign conventions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.1  \n\n\nA multi-section steel bar is supported by a fixed support at A and is subjected to torque TB = 70 N mm and TE = 30 N mm. Determine the internal torque at all points in the shaft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the loading consists of torques applied at two distinct points, the internal torque will be constant in the sections to the left and right of where the torques are applied. Therefore, the problem reduces down to determining the internal torque between A and B and the internal torque between B and E. Note that because A is a fixed support, there will be an additional torque (the reaction torque) there that can be determined by applying equilibrium to the whole shaft if necessary. In this particular example, we will discuss why the reaction force is not necessary to calculate the internal torques. \nTo determine the internal torque in section AB, we can cut the shaft anywhere between points A and B and draw an FBD of the section to the left of the cut (everything from point A to the cut) or the section to the right of the cut (everything from the cut to E). An illustration of the cut and the resulting FBD’s are shown below. Note that the internal torque TAB is drawn in opposite directions on the two sections. This must be the case if the bar is in equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore applying equilibrium, note the double headed arrows that represent the torques and the significance of the directions. In the above diagrams TAB is drawn as positive internal torque on both the left and right section diagrams since it points away from the cut in both instances. However, when summing moments (as shown below), the direction of the arrow will be used as the sign in the equilibrium equation.\nFor the applied loads, since TA is drawn in the negative x direction on the left side cut section, it is assumed to be negative (or look clockwise as viewed in the direction of E towards A). On the right side diagram, TB is drawn in the positive x direction since it appears counterclockwise as viewed from E towards A. Applied torque TE is drawn in the negative direction since it appears clockwise as viewed in the direction of E towards A.\nSince writing equilibrium equations based on the FBD of the left side section would require first determining the reaction torque at wall A, we will choose to use the FBD of the section to the right of the cut instead.\nRecall that torques are moments that cause the body to twist. In this problem the torques act around the x-axis. Applying the moment equilibrium equation on this section gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum M_x&=-T_{AB}+T_B-T_E=0 \\\\\n\\sum M_x&=-T_{A B}+70{~N}\\cdot{mm}-30{~N}\\cdot{mm}=0 \\\\\nT_{A B}&=40{~N}\\cdot{mm}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe positive result confirms that the assumed direction for TAB is the correct one, so it is a counterclockwise torque since it points away from the cut. The same result would have been obtained by applying equilibrium to the left side section after determining TA.\nSimilarly, the internal torque in all parts of the shaft between B and E can be determined by cutting the shaft at a non-specific point between B and E and applying equilibrium to the section of shaft to the left of the cut or the section to the right of the cut. The two FBD’s are shown below. Once again, the internal torque (TBE in this case) is drawn in the direction away from the cut on both sections, so it is assumed to be positive on both sections.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying the moment equilibrium equation on the right section gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum M_x&=-T_{BE}-T_E=0 \\\\\n\\sum M_x&=-T_{BE}-30{~}N\\cdot{mm}=0 \\\\\nT_{B E}&=-30{~N}\\cdot{mm}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe negative result indicates that TBE goes in the opposite direction than what is drawn, so it points towards the cut section and is clockwise.\nThe internal torque for all points between A and B is 40 N·mm counterclockwise.\nThe internal torque for all points between B and E is 30 N·mm clockwise.",

    "text": "6.1 Calculation of Shear Stress due to Pure Torsion\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nIn this section, the derivation of the shear stress equation for torque is explained before presenting it so that the inputs to the resulting equation, as well as the assumptions, etc., can be better understood.\nConsider a circular shaft that is fixed on one end and subjected to torque on the free end, as shown in Figure 6.8. The shaft has an outer radius, c, as shown in Figure 6.9 (B). For the given loading, the internal torque at any location along the shaft, x, would also be T.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Illustration of fixed end shaft subjected to torque and smaller sliver within the shaft.\n\n\n\nBefore the torque, T, is applied, a horizontal line segment drawn across a sliver of the shaft, marked by points A and B, has a length of Δx. Now let’s consider the same shaft segment after the torque has been applied and points A and B move to A’ and B’. An illustration of the resulting geometry can be seen in Figure 6.9 (A). Since the shaft is fixed on the left end, we see that point B on the shaft will rotate more than point A. We can approximate that line segment AB remains linear for a very narrow section of shaft (infinitely small Δx).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Illustration of the displacement of points A and B on the shaft (A) and the cross-section of the shaft (B).\n\n\n\nRecalling that shear strain is the change in the angle between two lines that are originally perpendicular, we can see that the angle of tilt in AB after the torque is applied is the shear strain, γ, that results from the torque. The displacement of point B from the original position to B’ on the cross-section is shown in Figure 6.9 (B). For an infinitely small Δx, the arc segment from B to B’ can be approximated as vertical so that the shear strain γ can be expressed using trigonometry as:\n\\[\n\\tan (\\gamma)=\\frac{B B^{\\prime}}{\\Delta x}\n\\]\nThe small angle approximation (again, based on an infinitely small Δx), gives:\n\\[\n\\gamma=\\frac{B B^{\\prime}}{\\Delta x}\n\\]\nNow consider the cross-section of the shaft where point B and B’ are located, shown in Figure 6.9 (B). As discussed above, B’ is the location point B moves to when the torque is applied, so the angle between the radial lines that go from the center to points B and B’, respectively, of the shaft segment is the angle of twist of the segment. Since we are considering just a section of the shaft, the angle is represented as Δφ (as opposed to the absolute angle of twist, φ, as measured from the fixed end). If the outer radius of the shaft is r = c, then the length of BB’ is given by the arclength, so:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{BB}^{\\prime}=\\mathrm{c}(\\Delta \\phi)\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\gamma=\\frac{c(\\Delta \\phi)}{\\Delta x}\n\\]\nGeneralizing this result for any point on the cross-section that is located at an arbitrary radial distance ρ from the center gives:\n\\[\n\\gamma=\\frac{\\rho(\\Delta \\phi)}{\\Delta x}\n\\]\nThe resulting expression of γ shows that the shear strain varies linearly with ρ from the center of the cross-section to the outer radius, as illustrated in Figure 6.10. The shear strain is 0 at the center, and the max shear strain occurs at the max value of ρ = c.\n\\[\n\\gamma_{\\max }=\\frac{c(\\Delta \\phi)}{\\Delta x}\n\\]\nSubstituting the general and max expressions for shear strain into Hooke’s Law for shear stress, τ = Gγ, reveals that shear stress also varies linearly from 0 to τmax in going from the center of the cross-section to the outer radius.\n\\[\n\\tau=G \\gamma=G \\frac{\\rho(\\Delta \\phi)}{\\Delta x}, \\tau_{\\max }=G \\frac{c(\\Delta \\phi)}{\\Delta x}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Shear strain and shear stress vary linearly from the center to the outer edge of the circular cross-section.\n\n\n\nLooking at Figure 6.10 shows that the slope of the linear variation is \\(\\frac{\\tau_{\\max }}{c}\\) and the shear stress can also be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\tau=\\frac{\\tau_{\\max }}{c} \\rho\n\\]\nThe last step in developing the shear stress relationship to torque involves considering the equilibrium of the shaft. Refer to Figure 6.11. If each point (i) on the cross-section with area dAi has a given amount of shear stress,τi, then the corresponding force at each point dFi can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{dF}_i=\\tau_i \\mathrm{dA}_i=\\frac{\\tau_{\\max }}{c} \\rho_i d A\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: Illustration of infinitesimal forces on the shaft cross-section.\n\n\n\nRecalling that the internal torque everywhere on the shaft is T, equilibrium dictates that the sum of the moments about the center of the cross-section should be equal to T. For an infinite number of points on the cross-section, this summation can be performed as an integral:\n\\[\nT=\\int d F_i \\rho_i=\\int \\frac{\\tau_{\\max }}{c} \\rho_i^2 d A\n\\]\nSince τmax and c are constant, they can be pulled outside the integral, leaving the integral portion to be \\(\\int \\rho_i^2 d A\\), which is the definition of the polar moment of inertia. The polar moment of inertia is the moment of inertia around the out of plane axis, which is the x-axis. The polar moment of inertia will be denoted with the letter J in this text.\nFor a solid circular cross-section of outer radius, r, and outer diameter, d:\n\\[\nJ_{solid}=\\frac{\\pi}{4} r^4=\\frac{\\pi}{64} d^4\n\\]\nFor a tube or hollow circular cross-section with outer radius and diameter, ro and do, respectively, and inner radius and diameter, ri and di, respectively:\n\\[\nJ_{hollow}=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\left(r_o^4-r_i^4\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{32}\\left(d_o^4-d_i^4\\right)\n\\]\nReplacing \\(J=\\rho^2_idA\\) in our previous equation gives:\n\\[\nT=\\frac{\\tau_{\\max } J}{c}\n\\]\nThis can be rearranged to:\n\\[\n\\tau_{\\max }=\\frac{T c}{J}\n\\]\nThis equation gives the maximum stress on a given cross-section, which will occur on the outer edge of the shaft (where \\(\\rho=c\\)). A more general form of the equation which can be used to find the stress at any point on the cross-section is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\tau=\\frac{T \\rho}{J}}\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nwhere\n𝜏 = Shear stress due to torsion [Pa, psi]\nT = Internal torque [N·m, lb·in.]\n𝜌 = Radial distance from center of cross-section to point of interest [m, in.]\nJ = Polar moment of inertia [m4, in.4]\nNote that for now, only the magnitude of the shear stress (without sign) will be determined since the sign for shear stress is not based purely on the sign of the torque. The sign on shear stress will be discussed in Chapter 12.\nExample 6.2 demonstrates the use of the above equations to determine shear stress in the same circular bar assembly used in Example 6.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.2  \n\n\nThe multi-section solid steel bar of example 6.1 is repeated here with the same loading (TB = 70 N mm and TE = 30 N mm). Also, given the diameters: dAC = 50 mm, dCD = 20 mm, and dDE = 35 mm, determine the magnitude and location of the max shear stress in the bar assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be seen from Equation 6.5 that the max shear stress will depend on the internal torque and the geometrical properties of the shaft. Therefore, to find the max shear stress, we must calculate the shear stress at the outer radius for each distinct section of the shaft for which the internal torque and/or cross-sectional dimensions change. Each segment of the bar for which the internal torque stays constant, and the cross-sectional dimensions stay constant will have constant shear stress. In this example, there are 4 distinct sections for which to calculate shear stress:\n\nSection AB which gets sectioned at B due to the applied torque\nSection BC which gets sectioned at C due to the geometry change at C\nSection CD which gets sectioned at D due to the geometry change at D\nSection DE which would get sectioned at E if E were not the end of the shaft\n\nFrom example 6.1, it is known that the magnitudes of the internal torque for all points between A and B, TAB, is 40 N mm and the internal torque for all points between B and E, TBE, is 70 N mm. Since the internal torque stays constant from B to E, it is known that TBC = TCD = TDE = 70 N mm. Recall that only the magnitude of shear stress will be calculated with the sign being discussed in Chapter 12.\nSince the bar has a solid cross-section with the diameters given, we will use \\(J_{solid}=\\frac{\\pi}{32} d^4\\) to calculate the polar moment of inertia at each section.\nNow we can calculate the maximum stress in each section:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\tau_{AB}=\\frac{T_{AB}*c_{AB}}{J_{AB}}=\\frac{0.04{~N}\\cdot{m}*\\frac{0.05}{2} {~m}} {\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.05{~m})^4}=1629.7{~Pa}=1.630{~kPa} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\tau_{BC}=\\frac{T_{BC}*c_{BC}}{J_{BC}}=\\frac{0.07{~N}\\cdot{m}*\\frac{0.05}{2}{~m}}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.05{~m})^4}=2852{~Pa}=2.85{~kPa} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\tau_{CD}=\\frac{T_{CD}*c_{CD}}{J_{CD}}=\\frac{0.07{~N}\\cdot{m}*\\frac{0.02}{2}~{m}}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.02{~m})^4}=44563{~Pa}=44.6{~kPa} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\tau_{DE}=\\frac{T_{DE}*c_{DE}}{J_{DE}}=\\frac{0.07{~N}\\cdot{m}*\\frac{0.035}{2}{~m}}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.035{~m})^4}=8315{~Pa}=8.32{~kPa}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nThe max shear stress in the bar is 44.6 kPa and occurs in section CD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Torsional stress\n\n\n\n\nUse equilibrium to determine reaction torques at any supports\nCut a cross-section through the member and draw a free body diagram of either everything to the left of the cut or everything to the right\nUse equilibrium to determine the internal torque in the member\nDetermine the torsional stress using \\(\\tau=\\frac{T\\rho}{J}\\)\nRepeat steps 2 - 4 as necessary.

    "section": "6.2 Calculation of Angle of Twist",
    "text": "6.2 Calculation of Angle of Twist\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nIn Chapter 5, we derived and applied a formula for axial deformation. We will do something similar in this chapter for circular shafts subjected to torsion. The deformation of a shaft that arises from applying torsion, assuming deformation is restricted to the elastic deformation range for the material, is quantified by the angle of twist, \\(\\phi\\). As discussed in Section 6.1, and illustrated here again in Figure 6.12, the angle of twist is the angle formed between the radial line that goes from the center of the cross section to a point in its original location and the radial line that goes from the center to the point in its new location after the torsional load is applied. The equation to determine angle of twist at various points along the shaft will be derived below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: The angle between B (original location) and B’ (where B moves to after torque is applied to the shaft) is the angle of twist, $\\phi$.\n\n\n\nRecall from Section 6.1 that the shear strain \\(\\gamma=\\frac{\\rho(\\Delta \\phi)}{\\Delta x}\\). Also recall that Δx represents the length of a section of shaft of arbitrary length and Δφ is the change in angle of twist that occurs across that length. For an infinitely small section of shaft, the shear strain equation can be expressed in terms of differentials: \\(\\gamma=\\frac{\\rho(d \\phi)}{d x}\\).\nNow applying Hooke’s Law, τ = Gγ, and the equation for shear stress we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho(d \\phi)}{d x}=\\frac{\\tau}{G}=\\frac{T \\rho}{J G}\n\\]\nSolving for dφ gives:\n\\[\nd \\phi=\\frac{T d x}{J G}\n\\]\nFor a section (i) of shaft of length Li for which torque (Ti), material (Gi), and geometry (Ji), stay constant, this becomes:\n\\[\n\\phi_i=\\frac{T_i L_i}{J_i G_i}\n\\]\nIntegrating both sides of the equation gives the total angle of twist for an entire shaft or section of shaft:\n\\[\n\\phi=\\int \\frac{T d x}{J G}\n\\]\nFor multi-section bodies where each individual section has constant T, J, and G, the integral can be expressed in the form of a sum where the angle of twist of each distinct section is calculated individually and then they are all added together:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\phi=\\phi_i=\\sum \\frac{T_i L_i}{J_i G_i}}\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\nwhere\n𝜙 = Change in angle [rad]\nT = Internal torque [N·m, lb·in.]\nL = Length [m, in.]\nJ = Polar moment of inertia [m4, in.4]\nG = Shear modulus [Pa, psi]\nIn these calculations, the sign of internal torque will be important as it indicates the direction of the twist. If one section twists in one direction and the adjoining section twists in the opposite direction, the effect will be that the angles will subtract from each other resulting in a smaller overall angle of twist. On the other hand, if two adjoining sections twist in the same direction, the effect will be additive. According to the assigned sign convention discussed in Section 6.1, an overall positive angle of twist indicates that the shaft twists counterclockwise when looking from the positive end of the longitudinal axis to the negative and vice versa.\n\n6.2.1 Units\nIf values for T, L, J, and G are used in Equation 6.2 such that the units are all consistent with each other, the overall unit works out to be unitless as is expected for an angle calculation. Since the calculation is for an angle, the actual unit is considered to be radians. If an angle is desired to be in degrees, the result of the equation would need to be converted by multiplying the result by π/180.\nBecause the angle of twist often works out to be very small, it may be desired to express the value in terms of μrad, which is 10-6 radians. To convert from rad to μrad, multiply the number of radians by 106.\n\n\n6.2.2 Notation\nWhen finding the angle of twist, the angle at any given point along the length of the shaft will be found relative to some reference point. Often the reference point is a fixed point (at a fixed support for example), so the relative angle is an absolute angle. In this case, the symbol \\(\\phi\\) will be subscripted with the point along the shaft where the angle was calculated. For example, given the shaft assembly in Figure 6.13 below, the notation φB denotes the angle of twist at point B relative to the fixed point A.\nIf one is finding the relative angle of twist between two non-fixed points that are on the same section of shaft (same T, J, and G), the angle of one point relative to another on the same section of shaft is notated with two subscripts specifying the two points. For example, the angle of twist of D relative to C in Figure 6.13 is notated as \\(\\phi_{CD}\\). In this case, one would perform the calculation for the angle of twist at D as if point C is fixed, in which case:\n\\[\n\\phi_{B C}=\\frac{T_{C D} L_{C D}}{J_{C D} G_{C D}}\n\\]\nIf one is finding the relative angle of twist between two non-fixed points (let’s say B and D in Figure 6.13) that are on different sections of shaft (i.e., there are 1 or more section changes between them due to changing T, J, or G), the relative angle of twist between them would be found by summing the angles of twist of each section between them. In this case, the notation would be \\(\\phi_{D/B}\\) which is said as the angle of twist of D relative to B. If point C is where the section change occurs, the calculation would be:\n\\[\n\\phi_{D / B}=\\phi_{B C}+\\phi_{C D}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.13: A multi-section body with fixed end A and constant torque conditions in sections\n\n\n\nThese concepts will be illustrated in Example 6.3 which continues with the same bar assembly and loading used in Example 6.1 and Example 6.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.3  \n\n\nThe multi-section steel bar of examples 6.1 and 6.2 is repeated here with the same loading (TB = 70 N·mm and TE= 30 N·mm). Given the diameters: dAC = 50 mm, dCD = 20 mm, and dDE = 35 mm, and section lengths LAB = 300 mm, LBC = 200 mm, LCD = 400 mm, and LDE = 700 mm, determine the angle of twist of points C, D, and E, all relative to point A which is attached to the fixed support. All sections have a shear modulus of G = 40 GPa. A negative result indicates a clockwise twist and a positive result indicates a counterclockwise twist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAs was the case when calculating shear stress in Example 6.2, the changes in torque and geometry result in 4 distinct sections for which the angle of twist will remain constant within the section but change going from one section to another. These sections are AB, BC, CD, and DE.\nIn example 6.1, it was shown that the internal torque in section AB is counterclockwise and equal to 40 N·mm. It was also shown that the internal torque in all sections between B and E is clockwise and equal to 30 N·mm. The directions in this case are relative to viewing in the direction from the positive end of the x-axis to the negative (i.e., point E to point A). This will mean that the angle of twist in section AB will be positive while the angle of twist in BC, CD, and DE will be negative.\nSince point A is a fixed point, \\(\\phi_{B / A}=\\phi_B=\\phi_{A B}\\).\n\\[\n\\phi_B=\\phi_{A B}=\\frac{T_{AB}L_{AB}}{J_{AB}G_{AB}}=\\frac{0.04{~N}\\cdot{m}*(0.300{~m})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.05{~m})^4\\left(40 \\times 10^9~\\frac{N}{{m}^2}\\right)}=4.889 \\times 10^{-7}{~rad}\n\\]\nTo find the angle of twist of point C relative to A, φC, we will need to add the angle of twist of section BC to that of section AB:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi_C&=\\phi_{A B}+\\phi_{BC}=4.889\\times 10^{-6}{~rad}+\\frac{T_{BC}L_{BC}}{J_{BC}G_{BC}} \\\\\n\\\\\n&=9.778\\times10^{-6}{~rad}+\\frac{-0.07{~N}\\cdot{m}*(0.200{~m})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.05{~m})^4\\left(40 \\times 10^9~\\frac{{N}}{{m}^2}\\right)} \\\\\n\\\\\n&=-8.149 \\times 10^{-8}{~rad}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that TBC was substituted in as a negative value as discussed above.\nTo find the angle of twist of point D relative A, φD, the angle of twist of section CD will be added to the that of AB and BC.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi_D&=\\phi_{AB}+\\phi_{BC}+\\phi_{CD}=-8.149\\times10^{-8} {~rad}+\\frac{T_{CD}L_{CD}}{J_{CD}G_{CD}} \\\\\n\\\\\n&=-8.149 \\times 10^{-7}{~rad}+\\frac{-0.07{~N}\\cdot{m}*(0.400{~m})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.02{~m})^4\\left(40 \\times 10^9~\\frac{{N}}{{m}^2}\\right)} \\\\\n\\\\\n&=-4.464 \\times 10^{-5} {~rad}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFinally, to find the angle of twist of E relative to A, φE, the angle of twist of section DE will be added to that of AB, BC, and CD.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi_E&=\\phi_{AB}+\\phi_{BC}+\\phi_{CD}+\\phi_{DE}=-4.464\\times 10^{-5}{~rad}+\\frac{T_{DE}L_{DE}}{J_{DE}G_{DE}} \\\\\n\\\\\n&=-4.464\\times 10^{-5}{~rad}+\\frac{-0.07{~N}\\cdot{m}*(0.700{~m})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.035{~m})^4\\left(40\\times 10^9~\\frac{{N}}{{m}^2}\\right)} \\\\\n\\\\\n&=-5.296\\times 10^{-5} {~rad}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nφB = 4.89 x 10-7 rad = .489 μrad (counterclockwise)\nφC = -8.149 x 10-8 rad = .0815 μrad (clockwise)\nφD = -4.46 x 10-5 rad = 44.6 μrad (clockwise)\nφE = -5.30 x 10-5 rad = 53.0 μrad (clockwise)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Angle of Twist\n\n\n\n\nUse equilibrium to determine reaction torques at any supports\nCut a cross-section through the segment of interest and draw a free body diagram of either everything to the left of the cut or everything to the right\nUse equilibrium to determine the internal torque in the segment\nDetermine the angle of twist of the segment using \\(\\phi=\\frac{TL}{JG}\\)\nRepeat steps 2 - 4 for all segments.

    "text": "6.3 Statically Indeterminate Torsion\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nAs was discussed in Section 5.5 for axial loading, one may sometimes encounter loading and constraint conditions that are statically indeterminate. In these situations, though a structure may be in static equilibrium, equilibrium equations do not provide enough equations to solve for all the unknown reactions. In many cases, the known constraints on deformation can be used to provide the additional necessary equations. We will consider the same two categories of statically indeterminate loading:\n\nRedundant supports—Cases where there are fixed supports at each end. In this configuration, the shaft is constrained on both ends such that the overall angle of twist must be 0 if both ends are truly fixed, or the angle of twist is limited to a specified amount if there is a fixed degree of freedom on one end (for example if one side involves a loose connection).\nCo-axial or parallel shafts—multiple shafts are bonded concentrically (one within another) so that they are constrained to twist as a unit by the same amount. In this case, the extra equation needed in addition to equilibrium comes from setting the angle of twist for each material equal to each other.\n\n\n6.3.1 Method of Superposition\nFor the case of redundant supports, an alternative would be to use the method of superposition. The method of superposition is based on the idea that the effects of individual loads on the deformation of a body can be calculated individually and then added together to get the total effect. To apply this method:\n\nTake away one of the redundant supports\nDetermine the total angle of twist of the shaft without the support\nReplace the support but take way the other loads\nDetermine the deformation in the shaft due to the reaction at the now replaced support\nSum the angle of twist from step 2 and step 4 and set the total equal to zero (or a given angle as appropriate).\nSolve the equation resulting from step 5 for the reaction at the redundant support and then use the whole body equilibrium to solve for the reaction at the other support(s).\n\nExample 6.4 demonstrates how to solve a statically indeterminate torsion problem that falls under the first category of problems described above. Example 6.5 uses superposition to solve part (a) of Example 6.4.\nExample 6.6 goes through the process of solving a statically indeterminate torsion problems that falls under the second category of problems described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.4  \n\n\nA shaft assembly consists of a 12 in long steel section AB (d = 10 in., G = 11600 ksi)) bonded rigidly to a 9 inch long solid brass section BC (d = 7 in., G = 5800 ksi). The assembly is to be bolted to walls A and C. If a torque TB of magnitude 2000 kip·in is applied at B, determine the shear stress in the steel section and the brass section after the ends are bolted for each of the following end conditions:\n\nBoth ends A and C are tightly connected immediately at installation\nThere is a slight misalignment at end A that necessitates that that end be turned by 0.5° before the bolts can be tightened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1 (for both (a) and (b))\nDraw the FBD of the whole body (see below) and write out relevant equilibrium equations. In this case, that would only be \\(\\sum M_x=0\\). Note that the assumed directions for TA and TC would usually said to be completely assumed, with the signs of the answers obtained for them indicating if the assumed directions are correct. For case(a), this is still true.\nHowever, for case (b), the direction of TA should be in the direction opposite to the way the shaft turns as a result of the applied torque, TB, before the bolt is tightened. The reason for this is illustrated in figure 3 below. The assumed direction of TC can be in either direction for both case (a) and case (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the choice of which way the positive x-axis goes on the whole body FBD is arbitrary. As long as the choice of signs applied to torques for any global (whole body) equation is based on the same assumption, it does not matter which direction is chosen to be the positive x direction. In this case where the positive direction is chosen to be going to the left, the signs on the torques will be based on the way the torques are perceived when looking in the direction from A towards C. Since the direction of TB is known to be counterclockwise from that perspective, it is drawn in the direction of the positive x-axis and following from that, TA is drawn to be in the direction of the negative x-axis. TC is assumed to be the same direction as T.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\sum M_x=-T_A+T_B-T_C=0 \\\\\nT_C+T_A=T_B\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nSince there are two unknowns (TA and TC), but only one equilibrium equation, the problem is statically indeterminate.\nStep 2\nApply kinematic constraint. For case (a), both ends are fixed at the time of installation so the total angle of twist in the shaft should be zero:\n\\[\n\\phi_A=\\sum \\frac{T L}{J G}=\\phi_{A B}+\\phi_{B C}=0\n\\]\nWhere TAB and TBC are the internal torques in each of those respective sections.\nFor case (b), the misalignment means end A must be turned by 0.5° before it gets locked in, so the magnitude of the total angle of twist is also 0.5°. The direction of twist is given by considering the loose end of the shaft to be a free end (as it would be before the bolt is tightened). If end A is a free end, the internal torque in section AB is 0 and the internal torque in section BC is equal to positive TB. Given that, we take the angle of twist in the bar at the time of bolt tightening to also be positive.\nSo for case (b), the kinematic equation is:\n\\[\n\\phi_A=\\sum \\frac{TL}{JG}=\\phi_{A B}+\\phi_{BC}=0.5^{\\circ} * \\frac{\\pi}{180^{\\circ}}\n\\]\nStep 3\nWrite the compatibility equation by substituting the appropriate torque-twist equations for the angles of twist.\nTo implement this step, the internal torque (and sign) for each section must be established by cutting sections and applying equilibrium.\nThe FBD for a section made by cutting through section AB is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equilibrium equation for this section is:\n\\[\n\\sum M_x=T_A-T_{A B}=0\n\\]\nSo TAB = TA in magnitude and is clockwise since the positive result for TAB in this case confirms that the arrow should be pointed toward the cut. Thus, the angle of twist in section AB should be negative.\n\\[\n\\phi_{AB}=-\\frac{T_{AB}L_{AB}}{J_{AB}G_{AB}}=\\frac{-T_A*(12{~in.})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(10{~in.})^4*(11600{~ksi})}\n\\]\nThe FBD for a section made by cutting through section BC is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equilibrium equation for this section is:\n\\[\n\\sum M_x=-T_{B C}+T_C=0\n\\]\nSo TBC = TC in magnitude and is counterclockwise since the positive result for TBC in this case confirms that the arrow should be pointed away from the cut. Thus, section BC will have a positive angle of twist.\n\\[\n\\phi_{B C}=+\\frac{T_{BC}L_{BC}}{J_{BC}G_{BC}}=\\frac{T_C*(9{~in.})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(7{~in.})^4*(5800{~ksi})}\n\\]\nSubstitute these equations into the compatibility equation for case (a):\n\\[\n\\frac{-T_A*(12{~in.})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(10{~in.})^4*(11600{~ksi})}+\\frac{T_C*(9 {~in.})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(7{~in.})^4*(5800{~ksi})}=0\n\\]\nAnd for case (b):\n\\[\n\\frac{-T_A*(12{~in.})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(10{~in.})^4*(11600{~ksi})}+\\frac{T_C*(9 {~in.})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(7{~in.})^4*(5800{~ksi})}=0.5^{\\circ}*\\frac{\\pi}{180^{\\circ}}\n\\]\nStep 4: Solve the equilibrium and compatibility equations for TA and TC.\nFor case (a):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&T_A=T_C\\left[\\frac{9{~in.}*\\frac{\\pi}{32}(10{~in.})^4*(11600{~ksi})}{12{~in.}*\\frac{\\pi}{32}(7{~in.})^4*(5800{~ksi})}\\right] \\\\\n\\\\\n&T_A=T_C[6.247] \\\\\n\\\\\n&\\text{Substitute into}~T_A+T_C=2000{~kip}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n\\\\\n&6.247T_C+T_C=2000{~kip}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n\\\\\n&T_C=276{~kip}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n&T_A=1724{~kip}\\cdot{in.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor case (b):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&T_A=\\left(\\frac{T_C*(9{~in.})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(7{~in.})^4*(5800{~ksi})}-0.5^\\circ*\\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ}\\right)*\\left(\\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(10{~in.})^4*11600{~ksi}}{12~in.}\\right) \\\\\n\\\\\n&T_A=T_C[6.247]-8282{~kip}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n\\\\\n&\\text{Substitute into}~T_A+T_C=2000{~kip}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n\\\\\n&6.247T_C+T_C-8282{~kip}\\cdot{in.}=2000{~kip}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n\\\\\n&T_C=1419{~kip}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n&T_A=581{~kip}\\cdot{in.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nsolving equations (1) and (8) gives TA = 581.3 kip in and TC = 1419 kip in. Both results work out to be positive, so the assumed directions are the actual directions.\nNow that the reaction torques are known and it was established from equations (3) and (5) that the internal torques TAB and TBC are equal in magnitude to TA and TC, respectively, the shear stresses in the two sections can be calculated.\nFor case a:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\tau_{AB}=\\frac{T_{AB}*c_{AB}}{J_{AB}}=\\frac{1724{~kip}\\cdot{in.}*5{~in.}}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(10{~in.})^4}=8.78{~ksi} \\\\\n& \\tau_{BC}=\\frac{T_{BC}*c_{BC}}{J_{BC}}=\\frac{276{~kip}\\cdot{in.}*3.5{~in.}}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(7{~in.})^4}=4.10{~ksi}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor case b:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\tau_{AB}=\\frac{T_{AB}*c_{AB}}{J_{AB}}=\\frac{581{~kip}\\cdot{in.}*5{in.}}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(10{~in.})^4}=2.96{~ksi} \\\\\n& \\tau_{BC}=\\frac{T_{BC}*c_{BC}}{J_{BC}}=\\frac{1419{~kip}\\cdot{in.}*3.5{~in}}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(7{in.})^4}=21.1{~ksi}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nCase a:\nτAB = 8.78 ksi\nτBC = 4.10 ksi\nCase b:\nτAB = 2.96 ksi\nτBC = 21.1 ksi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.5  \n\n\nRe-solve part (a) of example 6.4 using the method of superposition. The problem is repeated here for convenience.\nA shaft assembly consisting of a 12 in long steel steel section AB (d = 10 in, G = 11600 ksi)) bonded rigidly to a 9 inch long solid brass section BC (d = 7 in, G = 5800 ksi). The assembly is bolted to walls A and C. If both ends A and C are tightly connected to the walls and a torque TB of magnitude 2000 kip·in is applied at B, determine the shear stress in the steel section and the brass section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step to solving (global equilibrium) remains the same. The method of superposition will be applied in step 2 and step 3.\nStep 1 (for both (a) and (b))\nDraw the FBD of the whole body and write out the relevant equilibrium equations. The assumed directions for TA and TC are shown on the FBD as well as the direction used for the positive x-direction. Recall that the direction of the torque should be determined by looking from the positive x-axis towards the negative (A to C).\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying equilibrium in this case reduces down to the sum of the moments about the x-axis as the only non-trivial equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\sum M_x=-T_A+T_B-T_C=0 \\\\\nT_C+T_A=T_B\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nSince there are two unknowns (TA and TC), but only one equilibrium equation, the problem is statically indeterminate.\nStep 2: To apply the method of superposition, the support at C will be considered redundant. The angle of twist for end C relative to A will then be expressed based on two isolated loading conditions:\n\nWithout the reaction at C, so that the assembly acts as if it has a free end at C as shown in figure 3. In this case, since there is no torque applied between B and C, a section cut within BC shows that the that internal torque TBC must be 0 for equilibrium. A section cut through AB shows that the internal torque TAB = TB (clockwise, since it needs to point towards the cut for the section to be in equilibrium). Therefore, the angle of twist with this loading is:\n\\[\n\\phi_{C/A}=\\sum \\frac{TL}{JG}=\\frac{T_{AB}L_{AB}}{J_{AB} {G}_{AB}}=\\frac{-(2000{~kip}\\cdot{in.})*(15{~in.})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(10{in.})^4*(11600{~ksi})}=-4.215 \\times 10^{-3}{~rad}\n\\]\n\nWith the reaction at C, but no torque applied at B. Drawing the section FBD’s in this case reveals that both TAB and TBC are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction from TC. Since they are both pointed away from the cut, the direction is taken to be counterclockwise, or positive. Therefore, the angle of twist with this loading is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi_{C/A}&=\\sum\\frac{TL}{JG}=\\frac{T_{AB}L_{AB}}{J_{AB}{G}_{AB}}+\\frac{T_{BC}L_{BC}}{J_{BC}G_{BC}} \\\\\n\\\\\n&=\\frac{T_C*(12{~in.})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(10{~in.})^4*(11600{~ksi})}+\\frac{T_C*(9{~in.})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(7{~in.})^4*(5800{~ksi})} \\\\\n\\\\\n&=527\\times 10^5~T_{C}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nStep 3\nNow adding the effects of the isolated loading conditions gives the total angle of twist which should still be equal to zero when the ends are tightly bolted to the walls without extra twisting.\n\\[\n-4.215 \\times 10^{-3}{~rad}+1.527^* 10^{-5}~T{c}=0\n\\]\nStep 4\nSolving for TC gives TC = 276 kip·in which is the same result found in example 6.4.\nStep 5\nSubstituting this result into equation (1) also gives the same result as in example 6.4 for the reaction torque at A, TA = 1724 kip in.\nOnce again, the corresponding shear stresses are:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\tau_{AB}=\\frac{T_{AB}*c_{AB}}{J_{AB}}=\\frac{1724{~kip}\\cdot{in.}*5{~in.}}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(10{~in.})^4}=8.78{~ksi} \\\\\n& \\tau_{BC}=\\frac{T_{BC}*c_{BC}}{J_{BC}}=\\frac{276{~kip}\\cdot{in.}*3.5{~in.}}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(7{~in.})^4}=4.10{~ksi}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nτAB = 8.78 ksi\nτBC = 4.10 ksi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.6  \n\n\nThe vertical shaft assembly consists of a solid brass (G = 40 GPa) circular shaft completely bonded in section BC to a steel reinforcing tube (G = 80 GPa). The diameter of the brass is 25 mm along the whole length while the outer diameter of the steel is 50 mm. The assembly is subjected to torques TB = 800 N·m and TA = 300 N·m in the directions shown. Determine the shear stress in the brass in section AB and in BC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we’ll find the shear stress in the brass in section BC. We will need to determine how much of the internal torque within that section is carried by the brass.\nStep 1\nSince the reaction at C is not strictly necessary to solve this problem, the whole body FBD is not needed here. We will start by determining the internal reactions in section BC. Cut through section BC, draw the resulting FBD, and apply equilibrium.\n\\[\n\\sum M_x=T_A-T_B-T_{Br}-T_{St}=0\n\\]\nThere is only 1 non-trivial eqilibrium equation and two unknowns, so the problem is statically indeterminate.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\nApply the kinematic constraint. In this case, the materials are fully bonded in section BC, so the materials are constrained to twist as a unit in the that section. In BC, the kinematic equation is:\n\\[\n\\phi_{B r}=\\phi_{s t}\n\\]\nStep 3\nWrite the compatibility equation by substituting the appropriate torque twist equations into equation (2).\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{Br}L_{Br}}{J_{Br}G_{Br}}=\\frac{T_{St}L_{St}}{J_{St}G_{St}}\n\\]\nThe lengths are equal and therefore cancel out. Rearranging this equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT_{St}&=\\frac{T_{Br}J_{St}G_{St}}{J_{Br}G_{Br}} \\\\\n\\\\\n&=T_{BR}\\left[\\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{32}\\left((0.05{~m})^4-(0.025{~m})^4\\right)\\left(80 \\times 10^9~\\frac{{N}}{{m}^2}\\right)}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.025{~m})^4\\left(40 \\times 10^9 \\frac{{N}}{{m}^2}\\right)}\\right] \\\\\n\\\\\n&=30.0~T_{Br}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow substitute this into the equilibrium equation:\n\\[\n300{~N}\\cdot{m}-800{~N}\\cdot{m}-T_{Br}-30~T_{Br}=0 \\\\\nT_{Br}=-16.1 {~N}\\cdot{m}\n\\]\nApplying the shear stress equation gives:\n\\[\n\\tau_{Br(B C)}=\\frac{T_{Br}*c_{Br}}{J_{Br}}=\\frac{16.1{~N}\\cdot{m}*(0.0125{~m})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.025{~m})^4}=5.26{~MPa}\n\\]\nNext we’ll find the shear stress in the brass in section AB. Since this section consists only of the brass, all of the internal torque in that section is carried by the brass. Making a cut within that section and applying equilibrium shows that the magnitude of the internal torque TAB = TA = 300 N·m.\nApplying the shear stress equation gives:\n\\[\n\\tau_{Br(AB)}=\\frac{T_{Br}*c_{Br}}{J_{Br}}=\\frac{300{~N}\\cdot{m}*(0.0125{~m})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.025{~m})^4}=97.8{~MPa}\n\\]\nτBR in section BC is 5.26 MPa\nτBR in section AB is 97.8 MPa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Statically Indeterminate Structures\n\n\n\n\nDraw the FBD of the whole body and apply whichever equilibrium equations are relevant given the loading and geometry of the problem. For the pure torsion problems of this chapter, only the moment equilibrium about the longitudinal axis will be useful. All other equilibrium equations will be identically 0.\nWrite the equation of kinematic constraint, or the equation that expresses the restriction on the deformation. These equations would generally be:\n\n\\(\\sum \\phi=0\\) if a shaft assembly is tightly supported by fixed supports on the ends.\n\\(\\sum \\phi=\\text{angle}\\) if shaft assembly is supported by fixed supports on both ends but one is loose, misaligned, etc. such that there is some degree of freedom for the end to twist\nφ1 = φ2, where 1 and 2 represent two different shafts that are bonded together, with one around the other.\n\nWrite the compatibility equation by substituting the appropriate torque twist relationship (\\(\\phi=\\frac{T L}{J G}\\)) into the kinematic constraint equation.\nBy this point, you should have the same number of equations as unknowns.

    "text": "6.4 Power Transmission\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction to torsion, one common application in which one would encounter circular shafts subjected to torsion is in power transmission shafts. In these types of assemblies, shafts are connected through gears and belts and apply torque to one another through these connections. If a shaft somewhere in the assembly is connected to a motor that causes it to rotate, that rotation is then transmitted to other connected shafts which can in turn transmit rotation to even more shafts. Note that such systems are still considered to be in equilibrium even with the rotation as long as the angular velocity is constant.\n\n6.4.1 Definition of Power\nYou may recall from other subjects of study that power is defined to be the time rate of change of work. The definition of work is force times distance. So power can be calculated as:\n\\[\nP=\\frac{W}{t}=\\frac{F \\times d}{t}\n\\]\nWithin the context of rotating shafts, the force would be the force applied to the outer edge of the shaft that results in torque and the distance would be the arc length that a point on the edge of the shaft travels around the circumference in a given amount of time, t. Figure 6.14 illustrates this point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.14: Force applied to rotation shaft results in work\n\n\n\nIf the arclength over which point B travels, BB’ = rθ, then W = Frθ. However, Fr is also equal to the torque T on the shaft, so W = Tθ.\nGoing back to the power equation, we then have \\(P=\\frac{T \\theta}{t}\\). The \\(\\frac{\\theta}{t}\\) is angular velocity, which will be denoted with the Greek letter ω. So the power equation can finally be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{P = T\\omega}\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\nwhere\nP = Power [Watts, horsepower]\nT = Torque [N·m, lb·in.]\n𝜔 = Angular velocity [rad/sec]\n\n\n6.4.2 Units\nIn SI the standard unit for power is the Watt (W), which is (N·m)/s. The N·m unit is also referred to as a Joule, so a Watt is a Joule/s.\nIn US Customary units, power is commonly expressed as ft·lb/s or in·lb/s. However, it is also common to express power in terms of horsepower, where there are 550 ft·lb/s for 1 hp. Note that there is a conversion difference between the US horsepower and the British horsepower. In this text, horsepower will refer to the US version.\nWhen applying the P = Tω equation, the angular velocity ω must be expressed in radians per second. If frequency is given in Hz, which is 1 revolution/s, then one must multiply by 2π to convert it to rad/s since there are 2π rad per revolution.\nIf angular velocity is given in rpm, which is revolution per minute, then one must multiply by 2π radians per revolution and divide by 60 to convert 1/min to 1/s. This reduces to an overall multiplication factor of π/30 to convert from rpm to rad/s.\n\nTable 6.1: Power\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSI (watt)\n\\[

(Gear Ratio)\nConsider two connected gears as shown in Figure 6.15. The interaction of the teeth results in a force applied to each gear from the other. For equilibrium, this force must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. The force results in a torque which can be expressed as T = Fr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.15: Gear interaction results in the application of force and torque\n\n\n\nGiven that the force on each gear is equal in magnitude to the force on the other, we can write:\n\\[\nF=\\frac{T_A}{r_A}=\\frac{T_B}{r_B}\n\\]\nwhich then allows us to express the torque exerted by one gear in terms of the torque exerted by the other as well as the ratio of radii:\n\\[\n\\boxed{T_A=\\frac{r_A}{r_B} T_B}\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\nThe ratio of radii is known as the gear ratio. It can be expressed in terms of the ratio of gear radii, gear diameters, or the number of teeth on each gear.\n\n\n6.4.4 Angular Velocity Ratio of Connected Shafts\nWhen two shafts are connected by a pair of gears, conservation of energy would dictate that the power transferred into one shaft equals the power transferring out of the other (power in = power out, assuming losses are negligible).\nSo if PA = TAωA and PB = TBωB and PA = PB, then we get \\(\\omega_A=\\frac{T_B}{T_A} \\omega_B\\)\nFurther using the gear ratio relationship between TB and TA gives:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\omega_A=\\frac{r_B}{r_A} \\omega_B}\n\\tag{6.5}\\]\nNote that the gear ratio in this case is inverse of the one used to relate torques.\n\n\n6.4.5 Angle of Twist\nWhen two connected gears rotate, they will have equal arclengths of travel for a given amount of shaft rotation, but in opposite directions, as depicted in Figure 6.16. This means that rAφA = - rBφB, and the angle of twist at point B for the shaft that it is on can be related to the angle of twist at the same location on the shaft that gear A is on.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\phi_A=-\\frac{r_B}{r_A} \\phi_B}\n\\tag{6.6}\\]\nAs with the angular velocities, notice that the gear ratio is the inverse as that used to relate torques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.16: Connected gears travel the same distance in opposite directions.\n\n\n\nIn Example 6.7, a problem of power transmission with connected gears is presented which utilizes the above concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.7  \n\n\n60 kW of power is transmitted to gear D of the assembly at 33 Hz. Shaft CD is allowed to turn freely within its bearings in the direction shown at D. End A of shaft AB is attached rigidly to the wall. Determine the angle of twist of point D relative to A.\nAssume gear C has 35 teeth around it’s circumference and gear B has 50 teeth. In addition, shaft AB (d = 40 mm) is 450 mm long and shaft CD (d = 30 mm) is 700 mm long. Both shafts are made of steel (G = 80 GPa).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, we can think of the angle of twist at D to be equal to whatever the angle of twist of point C is plus the angle of twist of shaft CD. If the shaft were completely co-linear (no gear connection), the angle of twist at B would be equal to the angle of twist at C. In this case, we would calculate the angle of twist as:\n\\[\n\\phi_{D / A}=\\phi_{A B}+\\phi_{C D}\n\\]\nHowever, the gear connection causes the angle of twist at point C on shaft CD to be different from the angle of twist of point B, so we will express the angle of twist at D as:\n\\[\n\\phi_{D / A}=\\phi_C+\\phi_{C D}\n\\]\nTo calculate the angle of twist at D, we will need to:\n\nCalculate the torque being applied at D based on the power information.

The FBD of a section cut from AB shows that the internal torque TAB = TB. Note that the direction of TB is shown as clockwise when viewed in the direction of B towards A. One can determine this based on the fact that shaft CD is shown to rotate counterclockwise, which results in a clockwise torque imposed from gear C onto gear B. Equilibrium shows that the internal torque TAB is then also clockwise so φB will be negative.\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\phi_B=\\frac{T_{AB}L_{AB}}{J_{AB}G_{AB}}=-\\frac{413.4{~N}\\cdot{m}*(0.450{~m})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(0.04{~m})^4\\left(80 \\times 10^9~\\frac{{N}}{{m}^2}\\right)}=-0.009252{~rad}\n\\]\nUse the gear ratio to relate the angle of twist at B to the angle of twist at C:\n\\[\n\\phi_C=-\\frac{N_B}{N_C} \\phi_B=-\\frac{50}{35}(-.009252{~rad})=0.01322{~rad}\n\\]\nDetermine and use the internal torque TCD to determine φCD.

    "text": "6.5 Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways\n\n\n\nTorque is a moment applied around the longitudinal axis of a body. It causes a rotational deformation known as angle of twist. In a circular cross-section, the cross-section remains plane after deformation.\nTorsional stress is a shear stress. Both stress and strain vary from 0 at the center of a circular cross-section to a maximum value on the outer edge of the cross-section.\nInternal torques can be determined by cutting a cross-section through the member, drawing a free body diagram, and applying equilibrium equations. Torques are considered positive if they act counterclockwise when viewed from the cut section. This is most easily visualized with the right hand rule. The sign of the torque affects the sign of the stress and deformation.\nIt is typically sufficient at this stage to calculate the magnitude of the stress, but the sign of the angle of twist is important. Many problems involve multiple segments experiencing different stresses and deformations. The stress and angle of twist may be determined for each segment independently, but we often need to sum deformations across multiple segments so the correct sign must be maintained.\nOne common scenario where torques are present is power transmission. It is common that we know the amount of power and the angular velocity, and need to determine the torque. Problems involving power transmission often involve shafts with connected gears. These gears alter the torque and angle of twist according to the ratio of their radii.

Typically, these loads are perpendicular to the axis of the beam and cause only shear and bending moments. Figure 7.1 shows some examples.\nAs we found in previous chapters, internal forces and moments are crucial to calculating stresses and deflections. The same is true for finding stresses and deflections in beams. Due to the nature of the loadings and constraints of beams, finding internal forces requires new methods in statics. This chapter describes these methods for finding a beam’s internal shear force and bending moments.\nIn Section 7.1 we’ll review how to find the internal shear force and bending moments at a specific point in a beam using equilibrium. In Section 7.2 we’ll discuss the relationships between the applied load, the internal shear force, and the internal bending moment.\nWe’ll then discuss a more general approach to visualizing the internal shear force and bending moment at different points in a beam using shear force and bedning moment diagrams. In Section 7.3 we’ll explore how to draw these diagrams using an equilibrium method. Then in Section 7.4 we’ll discuss an alternative graphical method for drawing these diagrams.\n\nSign convention\nBefore we can present methods for finding internal shear and moments of beams, we need to establish a sign convention. This way, we provide consistency and know how to interpret our results. It should be noted that anytime you start a new project or subject you should ensure that a sign convention is established.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Sign convention for internal shear force (V) and bending moment (M)\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this book, the shear is positive when the external forces shear off as depicted in Figure 7.2. Another way to think about it is that a positive shear is when the internal shear forces cause a clockwise rotation of the beam segment.\nThe bending moment is positive when the external forces bend the beam in a concave up shape as indicated in Figure 7.2. This causes the top fibers of the beam to be in compression while the bottom fibers are in tension.",

    "text": "7.1 Internal Shear Force and Bending Moment by Equilibrium\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nOne way to find internal shear and bending forces is to cut sections and analyze the free-body diagrams, as we did in previous chapters of this book. The first step for a statically determinate beam is to find the external reactions. To determine the internal forces at any point along the beam, cut the section at that point and draw the free-body diagram from that point to one end of the beam. We will include the internal shear force, V, and internal bending moment, M, at the cut section and then use equilibrium equations to solve for those internal loads. This process is demonstrated in Example 7.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.1  \n\n\nFind the internal shear and bending moment at points J, K, and L in the beam pictured below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to find the external reactions at the supports A and B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum F_x=A_x=0 \\\\\n& \\sum M_A=-40{~kips}*4{~ft}-10{~kips}*18{~ft}+B_y*20{~ft}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad B_y=17{~kips} \\\\\n& \\sum F_y=A_y-40-10+17=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad A_y=33{~kips}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNext, we will draw a free-body diagram of the right end of the beam from point A to J by cutting the beam at section J. The internal forces VJ and MJ are placed at the point of the cut using the positive sign convention. Note: You can assume the direction of these forces; the statics will work out the correct direction.\nSection J\nTo find the internal shear, we will sum forces in the y-direction.

    "text": "7.2 Relationship between Load, Shear, and Moment\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nThere is a relationship between loading, shear, and moment (and as you will see later in this text, slope and deflection) in a beam. Consider the beam in Figure 7.3, which is subjected to a distributed load, w per unit length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Small segment of a beam subjected to an arbitrary distributed load.\n\n\n\nWe will now look at a small section from that beam that has a width of Δx, shown below. We replaced the distributed load with a resultant force ΔF (this is indicated by a dashed arrow in the FBD).\nSince we cut both sides of the beam, we replace each cut with internal shear and moment forces assuming the positive sign convention from the previous section in this chapter.\n\n7.2.1 Relationship between Load and Shear\nThis FBD is in static equilibrium so we can use our equilibrium equation to sum forces in the y-direction and set it equal to zero.\n\\[\n\\sum F_y=V-\\Delta F-(V+\\Delta V)=0 \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\Delta V=\\Delta F}\n\\tag{7.1}\\]\nOr \\[\n\\Delta V=w\\Delta x\n\\]\nDividing both sides by Δx and then letting Δx approach zero gives us:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta x}=\\frac{d v}{d x}=w\n\\]\nWe could then rearrange this by multiplying both sides of the equation by dx.\n\\[\nd v=w d x\n\\]\nNow we can integrate between any two points A and B on the beam:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\underbrace{\\Delta v}_{\\substack{\\text{change in} \\\\ \\text{shear}}}=\\int\\underbrace{w d x}_{\\substack{\\text{area under} \\\\ \\text {loading curve}}}}\n\\tag{7.2}\\]\nThis equation is valid for distributed loads and not when there is a discontinuity in the shear diagram that is caused by concentrated loads. This relationship should only be used between concentrated loads.\n\n\n7.2.2 Relationship between Shear and Moment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Free body diagram of a small segment of a beam subjected to an arbitrary distributed load.\n\n\n\nLet’s go back to the FBD of the small section of the beam subjected to a distributed load. This segment is shown in Figure 7.4. We can apply another static equilibrium equation, summing moments about point C:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum M_c=0 & =-M-V(\\Delta x)+\\Delta F\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta x\\right)+(M+\\Delta M) \\\\\n\\Delta M & =M+V \\Delta x-(w \\Delta x)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta x\\right)-M \\\\\n\\Delta M & =V \\Delta x-\\frac{1}{2} w \\Delta x^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nDividing both sides by Δx and then letting Δx approach zero gives us:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\underbrace{\\frac{\\Delta M}{\\Delta x}}_{\\text { Slope of moment diagram}}=\\underbrace{V}_{\\text {shear }}}\n\\tag{7.3}\\]\nWe could then rearrange this by multiplying both sides of the equation by dx.\n\\[\nd M=V d x\n\\]\nNow we can integrate between any two points A and B on the beam:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\underbrace{\\Delta M}_{\\text {Change in moment}}=\\underbrace{\\int V d x}_{\\text {Area under shear diagram }}}\n\\tag{7.4}\\]\nThis equation is not valid at points where a concentrated force or concentrated moment occurs. These concentrated loads cause discontinuities in the moment diagram.\n\n\n7.2.3 How can I use my calculus knowledge when building Shear and Moment Diagrams?\nIn a basic sense, the relationship between load, shear, and moment can be described in Figure 7.5 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Relationship between load, shear, and moment\n\n\n\nWe can combine these relationships with what we know about derivatives and integrals from our calculus course. Here are some items of note:\n\nThe slope of the shear diagram at any point is the derivative of the shear function evaluated at that point. This is equal to the sign and magnitude of the distributed load. If there is no load on a section of the beam then the slope of the shear diagram would be zero.\nSimilarly, the slope of the moment diagram at any point is the derivative of the moment function evaluated at that point. This is equal to the sign and magnitude of the shear at that point.\nThe area under the distributed load between two points is equal to the change in the shear between those same two points.\nThe area under the shear diagram between two points is equal to the change in the moment between those same two points.\nThe maximum moment occurs where its derivative (shear) is equal to zero.\nAt the points of concentrated forces, the shear diagram will jump up or down depending on the direction of the force. If the force is up then the shear diagram will jump up, and if the force is down, the shear diagram will drop down.\nAt the points of concentrated moments, the moment diagram will jump up or down depending on the direction of the rotation. If the concentrated moment is clockwise, the moment diagram will jump up, and if it is counter-clockwise, the moment diagram will drop down. This “opposite” direction effect is for the internal bending moment is the reaction to the applied moment to stay consistent with the established sign convention. The shear diagram will not be impacted.\nIf the load can be represented with a polynomial, then we can easily predict the degree of the subsequent shear and moment functions. For example, if the load is a uniformly distributed load (constant), the shear will be a linear function (n+1), and the moment will be a parabola (n+2).\n\nUse all that you know about calculus and the relationships between functions when you derive and integrate to build, check, and analyze your shear and moment diagrams.",

    "section": "7.3 Determining Equations by Equilibrium and Equations",
    "text": "7.3 Determining Equations by Equilibrium and Equations\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nThe relationship between load, shear, and moment allows us to build complete shear and moment diagrams using a few different methods. We’ll explore two of them - an equilibrium method and a graphical method.\nIn Section 7.1 we found the internal shear force and bending moment at specific points in the beam by cutting a cross-section at a given point and using equilibrium. The method in this section is similar, but instead of cutting a cross-section at a specific point we’ll instead cut a cross-section at distance ‘x’ from the left end of the beam. We’ll draw a free body diagram and determine the internal shear force (V) and bending moment (M) as before, but this time we’ll end up with equations for V and M that are functions of distance x.\nTo draw the diagrams, we can solve this equation at two values of x. It is often simplest to solve when x = 0 and when x = L, the length of the beam. This gives us two points on our diagram which we can then connect. The shape of the diagram depends on the highest power of x that appears in the equation.\n\nFor x0 we get a flat horizontal line\nFor x1 we get a straight diagonal line\nFor x2 we get a curved line\nFor x3 we get a steeper curve\n\nIf two points are not sufficient to determine the exact shape of the curve, simply solve the equations at a 3rd point (for example, where x = L/2). We can solve the equations at as many points as necessary but 2 - 3 points, along with knowledge of the general shape of the line, are typically sufficient.\nThe equations found using this method are valid as long as the external loading does not change. In cases where the external loading does change, we’ll need to determine a new set of equations each time the loading changes. This includes any time a distributed load begins or ends, and both sides of a concentrated force or couple. In each region of load, we will cut a cross-section at distance x and determine equations for V and M that are valid for that region. We can then solve each equation at values of x at the start and end of their valid region and build up the complete shear force and bending moment diagrams.\nExample 7.2 illustrates this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.2  \n\n\nDraw the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the beam shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to draw a FBD of the beam being sure to change the supports to the correct external reaction forces, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will then use static equilibrium equations to solve for the magnitude of the support reactions.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\sum F_x=A_x=0 \\\\\n&\\sum M_A=-4\\frac{kips}{ft}*6{~ft}*3{~ft}-18{~kips}*8{~ft}+B_y*10{~ft}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad B_y =21.6{~kips} \\\\\n&\\sum F_y=A_y-4\\frac{kips}{ft}*6{~ft}-18{~kips}+21.6{~kips}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad A_y =20.4{~kips}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will cut a cross-section within the loading region we are concerned with. When choosing sections be sure to cut within the uniform load and between loads and reactions. For this example, we will need to cut three sections to get the complete shear and moment diagram. These sections are depicted with the green lines. We will then use equilibrium equations to find the internal shear force as a function of x, V(x).\nSection between A and C\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\sum F_y=20.4-4(x) -V=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad V(x)=-4 x+20.4 \\\\\n&\\sum M_0=-20.4(x)+4(x)\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+M=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad M(x)=-2 x^2+20.4 x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNotice that you can give a quick check on your statics as V(x) is the derivative of M(x). For polynomials, this is a quick test to see if your equations make sense.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot our V(x) and M(x) equations on an axis from x = 0 to x = 6ft. Solving our equations at these points gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&V(0)=-4(0)+20.4=20.4{~kips} \\\\\n&V(6)=-4(6)+20.4=-3.6{~kips}\n\\\\\n&M(0)=-2(0)^2+20.4(0)=0 \\\\\n&M(6)=-2(6)^2+20.4(6)=50.4{~kip}\\cdot{ft}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNotice how we draw the shear diagram directly below the beam and the moment diagram directly below the shear. These three (load, shear, and moment) share the same x-axis, whereas the vertical axis for the Shear (V) and Moment (M) diagrams have different units and possibly different scales.\nDrawing the shear and moment diagrams directly below the beam is good practice so that you can get a complete picture of what is going on along the length of the beam.\nSection between C and D\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum &F_y=20.4-4(6)-V=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad V(x)=-3.6 \\\\\n\\sum &M_0=-20.4(x)+4(6)(x-3)+M=0 \\\\\n&M(x)=+20.4 x-24 x+72 \\\\\n&M(x)=-3.6 x+72 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we can add the section from C to D using our V(x) and M(x) equations. You will notice that since there are no applied loads on the beam from C to D, the shear diagram is constant. This means that the moment diagram is linear between x = 6 and x = 8 ft.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&V(6)=-3.6{~kips} \\\\\n&M(6)=-3.6(6)+72=50.4{~kip}\\cdot{ft} \\\\\n&V(8)=-3.6 {kips} \\\\\n&M(8)=-3.6(8)+72=43.2{~kip}\\cdot{ft} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSection between D and B\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum &F_y = 20.4-4(6)-18-V=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad V(x) =-21.6 \\\\\n\\sum &M_0 =-20.4(x)+4(6)(x-3)+18(x-8)+M=0 \\\\\n& M(x) =20.4 x-24 x+72-18 x+144 \\\\\n&M(x) =-21.6 x+216\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we will graph the V(x) and M(x) equations we obtained from point D to point B (x = 8 to x = 10 ft).\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&V(8)=-21.6{~kips} \\\\\n&M(8)=-21.6(8)+216=43.2{~kip}\\cdot{ft} \\\\\n&V(10)-21.6{~kips} \\\\\n&M(10)=-21.6(10)+216=0 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe now have complete shear and moment diagrams. Be sure that you label your axis, including units, and all pertinent values.\nThese diagrams are used in the design of the beam and its components.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that in this example, the entire length of the beam is subjected to positive moment. Going back to our sign convention from the beginning of this chapter, a positive moment indicates a concave up behavior. When we look at the beam and the external loads it makes sense as the beam will want to bend concave up between supports, as shown in the figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams (Equilibrium Method)\n\n\n\n\nUse equilibrium to determine the reaction loads at any supports\nIdentify the distinct regions of external loading and cut a cross-section within each region\nDraw a free body diagram of the left side of the first cut, which should be made at distance x1.

    "text": "7.4 Graphical Method Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nAn alternative, and often quicker, method for drawing shear force and bending moment diagrams is known as the graphical method. Due to the relationship between load, shear force, and bending moment, we can use one diagram to draw the next.\nSpecifically, we saw in Section 7.2 that \\(\\frac{dV}{dx}=w\\) and \\(\\frac{dM}{dx}=V\\). That is, the change in shear with respect to x (i.e. the slope of the shear diagram at any given point) is equal to any applied distributed load at that point and the change in bending moment with respect to x (i.e. the slope of the bending moment diagram at any given point) is equal to the shear force at that point.\nFurther, any applied concentrated forces cause a discontinuity on the shear force diagram (an upwards applied load causes the diagram to jump up). Any applied couples cause a discontinuity on the bending moment diagram (a clockwise applied couple causes the diagram to jump up). This allows us to draw the shape of the shear force diagram based on the applied loads, and the shape of the bending moment diagram based on the shear force diagram.\nFinally, we also know from Equation 7.2 that the change in shear force between any two points is equal to the area under the distributed load between those same two points. We know from Equation 7.4 that the change in bending moment between any two points is equal to the area underneath the shear force diagram between those two points. This allows us to add numbers to our diagrams and determine the value of the shear force and bending moment at key points.\nWhen the loading is relatively simple, consisting of concentrated forces, concentrated moments, and uniformly distributed loads, we can use geometry to find the area of the load and shear diagrams since the shapes are simple. Example 7.3 and Example 7.4 illustrate this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.3  \n\n\nDraw the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the beam shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to draw a FBD of the beam, being sure to change the supports to the correct external reaction forces, as shown below.\nWe will then use static equilibrium equations to solve for the magnitude of the support reactions.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\sum F_x=A_x=0 \\\\\n&\\sum M_A=-4\\frac{kN}{m}(6{~m})(5{~m})-10{~kN}(8{~m})+B_y(10{~m})-15{~kN}(12{~m})=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad B_y =38{~kN} \\\\\n&\\sum F_y=A_y-4\\frac{kN}{m}(6{~m})-10{~kN}-15{~kN}+38{~kN} \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad A_y =11{~kN}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow that we know the external forces, we can build the shear diagram. We will start at the leftmost point of the beam, point A.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first force we encounter is at point A, the reaction force of 11kN. The force is going up, so we will do that same thing on our shear diagram.\nFrom that point, we look at the beam, and there are no forces acting between points A and C. This indicates that our shear diagram will remain constant at 11kN.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 4kN/m uniformly distributed load starts at point C and goes for 6 meters until point D. The force is going down for a total of 24kN (4kN/m * 6m). Since the load is constant from point C to D, the shear will be linear between those points. The slope of the shear diagram will be -4 and over those 6 meters will decrease the total of 24kN.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt point D, there is a concentrated 10kN load going down. On the shear diagram, this load will be represented by a discontinuity, jumping down by 10kN to -23kN.\nFrom that point, we look at the beam, and there are no forces acting between points D and B. This indicates that our shear diagram will remain constant at -23kN.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt point B, the roller support, there is an external reaction of 38kN going up. This concentrated force will cause a discontinuity in the shear diagram. From -23kN we will add 38kN to end at 15kN.\nFrom that point, we look at the beam, and there are no forces acting between points B and E. This indicates that our shear diagram will remain constant at 15kN.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt point E, there is a 15kN concentrated force going down. This concentrated force will cause a discontinuity in the shear diagram. From 15kN we subtract 15kN to end back at zero.\nThe shear diagram should start and end at zero. At the end of the beam, our shear diagram “closes,” which means that we end back at zero. This is a good check that you are on the right track. If you round your reactions you might be slightly off at the end of your shear diagram.\nNow that we have the shear diagram, we can build the moment diagram. Remember from the previous section that the internal moment is the area under the shear diagram. Our shear diagram consists of basic shapes (rectangles and triangles) so we can use geometry to find these areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like for the shear diagram, we will start at zero at the leftmost point of the beam, point A. Our first section from A to C is a rectangle. We will calculate the area under the shear curve to find the change in the internal moment between A and C. We will keep in mind the following three things:\n\nMagnitude of the Change. This is the area under the curve. The height of the rectangle is 11kN, and the width is 2m, so the area is 22kN*m.\nDirection of the Change. This area is on the positive side of the shear diagram, which indicates that it will go up from A to C.\nShape of the Segment. The shear diagram is constant, so the moment diagram will be linear with a slope of 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom point C to D there are two triangles, one that is on the positive side of the shear diagram and the other that is on the negative side.\nTo calculate the area under the curve we will need to first calculate the distance from point C to where the shear diagram crosses the x-axis.\nThere are many ways to do this. We illustrate using similar triangles to find this distance. In the figure, we are comparing the larger yellow triangle and the smaller pink triangle, where our unknown distance x is the base. We set up the following proportion to accomplish this:\n\\[\n\\frac{24{~kN}}{6{~m}}=\\frac{11{~kN}}{x} \\quad \\therefore \\quad x=2.75 \\mathrm{~m}\n\\]\nMagnitude of the Change\nThis is the area under the curve. The area of the triangle is 15.125 kN*m [A = ½ (2.75m)(11kN)]\nDirection of the Change\nThis area is on the positive side of the shear diagram, which indicates that it will go up from C to the zero point on the shear diagram. So we will add the area, 15.125, to the internal moment at point C (22kN*m) to be at 37.125 kN*m at the point of zero shear.\nShape of the Segment\nThe shear diagram is linear, so the moment diagram will be parabolic that is concave down.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now account for the second triangle from C to D.\nMagnitude of the Change\nThis is the area under the curve. The area of the triangle is\n\\(A=\\frac{1}{2}*(6-2.75)*13=21.125{~kN\\cdot m}\\)\nDirection of the Change\nThis area is on the negative side of the shear diagram, which indicates that it will go down from the point of zero shear to point D. So we will subtract the area, 21.125 to the internal moment at the zero point (37.125kN) to be at 16 kN*m at the point D.\nShape of the Segment\nThe shear diagram is linear, so the moment diagram will be parabolic that is concave down. The concavity of a parabolic function can be determined by examining whether the shear diagram is increasing or decreasing. In this example, the shear diagram is decreasing between points C and D so the parabola will be concave down.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are now able to account for the section from D to B.\nMagnitude of the Change\nThis is the area under the curve. The height of the rectangle is 23kN, and the width is 2m, so the area is 46kN*m.\nDirection of the Change\nThis area is on the negative side of the shear diagram, which indicates that it will go down from D to B. We will subtract the area from the internal moment at D. So we will do 16 - 46 to end at negative 30.\nShape of the Segment\nThe shear diagram is constant, so the moment diagram will be linear with a slope of -23.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can build our moment diagram from B to E.\nMagnitude of the Change\nThis is the area under the curve. The height of the rectangle is 15kN, and the width is 2m, so the area is 30kN*m.\nDirection of the Change\nThis area is on the positive side of the shear diagram, which indicates that it will go up from B to E. We will add the area from the internal moment at B. So we will do (-30 + 30) to end at zero.\nShape of the Segment\nThe shear diagram is constant, so the moment diagram will be linear with a slope of +15.\nAt the end of the beam, our moment diagram “closes,” which means that we end back at zero. Moment diagrams must start and end at zero. This is a good check that you are on the right track. If you round your reactions and areas, you might be slightly off at the end of your moment diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur final product is in the figure on the left. For a complete shear and moment diagram your axis should be labeled, including units, and the pertinent values indicated on each diagram. As we mentioned earlier it is best to draw these right below the beam so it is easy to see what the internal shear and bending moment forces are in relation to a location on the beam.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that in this example, this beam is subjected to both positive and negative moments. Remember from the beginning of this chapter that a positive moment indicates concave up bending behavior, and a negative is concave down. When we look at the beam and the external loads it makes sense as the beam will want to bend concave up between supports in the area of positive moment. The beam will then bend concave down over support B in the area of negative moment, as shown in the figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7.4  \n\n\nDraw the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the beam shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis beam a little different than other examples in this chapter as the support is a fixed end and includes a force-couple system at point C. However, the processes that we presented here still apply in this situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to draw a FBD of the beam, being sure to change the supports to the correct external reaction forces, as shown to the left. The 2 kips that acts on the arm at point B will cause a force on beam AD at the connection point, C. Additionally there will be a concentrated moment from this force that also acts at point C. The magnitude of this concentrated moment is (2kips)*(1 ft) or 2 k*ft counter clockwise.\nWe will then use static equilibrium equations to solve for the magnitude of the support reactions.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\sum F_x=A x=0 \\\\\n&\\sum F_y=A_y-2{~kips}-5{~kips}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad A_y=7{~kips} \\\\\n&\\sum M_A = M_A + 2{~kip\\cdot ft} - 2{~kips}(3{~ft}) - 5{~kips}(6{~ft})=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad M_A=34{~kip\\cdot ft} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now build the shear diagram. Keep in mind that the concentrated moments (at point A and C) do not contribute to the shear diagram.\nWe start with the vertical reaction at point A. This is going up 7 kips. Then between A and C there are no loads on the beam so the shear diagram remains constant.\nThe concentrated force at point C is 2 kips down. So we will subtract 2 kips from 7 kips. There are no loads between points C and D so the shear diagram remains constant at 5 kips.\nAt point D there is a concentrated load of 5 kips down. This will bring our shear diagram to a close at zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will build the moment diagram with the combination of the area of the shear diagram and the concentrated moments.\nWe start from zero and go down 34 kip·ft since the reaction at A, MA, is counter-clockwise.\nBetween A and B\nMagnitude of the Change\nThis is the area under the curve. The height of the rectangle is 7 kips, and the width is 3 ft, so the area is 21 kip·ft.\nDirection of the Change\nThis area is on the positive side of the shear diagram, which indicates that it will go up from A to C. We will add the area from the internal moment at A (-34 + 21 = -13 kip·ft).\nShape of the Segment\nThe shear diagram is constant, so the moment diagram will be linear with a slope of +7 kips/ft.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt point C, there is an applied concentrated moment of 2 kip·ft counter-clockwise. This will create a discontinuity in the moment diagram by dropping down 2 (-13 – 2 = -15 kip·ft).\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween C and D\nMagnitude of the Change\nThis is the area under the curve. The height of the rectangle is 5 kips, and the width is 3 ft, so the area is 15 kip·ft.\nDirection of the Change\nThis area is on the positive side of the shear diagram, which indicates that it will go up from C to D. We will add the area from the internal moment at A (-15 + 15 = 0).\nShape of the Segment\nThe shear diagram is constant, so the moment diagram will be linear with a slope of +5 kip/ft.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final shear and moment diagram is in the figure to the left. You will notice that this cantilever structure with downward loads will bend concave down. This indicates that the entire beam will be in negative moment—which is what our moment diagram indicates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams (Graphical Method)\n\n\n\n\nUse equilibrium to determine the reaction loads at any supports\nUse the loading diagram to draw the shear force diagram. Begin at the left end of the beam and move to the right, obeying these rules\n\nA concentrated force causes a discontinuity on the shear diagram. An upwards force causes a jump upwards\nA distributed load causes a slope on the shear diagram equal to the size of the distributed load. An upwards load causes a slope upwards\n\nThe total change in shear force due to a distributed load is equal to the area underneath the distributed load\n\nAnywhere there are no applied forces, the shear force does not change\nThe shear force diagram should start and end at zero. If it does not, go back and check for errors\n\nOnce the shear force diagram is complete, use it to draw the bending moment diagram. Begin at the left end of the beam and move to the right, obeying these rules\n\nAn applied couple causes a discontinuity on the moment diagram. A clockwise couple causes a jump upwards\nThe slope of the moment diagram at any point is equal to the shear force at that point. As the shear force changes, the slope of the moment diagram will change too\n\nIf the shear force is zero, the bending moment will be constant\nIf the shear force is constant, the slope of the moment diagram will be linear\nIf the shear force is linear, the slope of the moment diagram will be parabolic\nIf the shear force is posiitve, the moment diagram will slope upwards\nIf the shear force is negative, the moment diagram will slope downwards\nAs the magnitude of the shear force gets larger, the slope of the bending moment diagram gets steeper\n\nThe bending moment diagram should start and end at zero. If it does not, go back and check for errors",

    "section": "8.1 Centroid",
    "text": "8.1 Centroid\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nAn object possesses weight due to the gravitational force acting on its constituent particles. The collective effect of these forces yields the total weight of the object, which is concentrated at a single point known as the center of gravity. If the object is comprised of a homogenous (constant density) material, then the center of gravity is the same as the geometric center or centroid. In this section, we will focus our discussions on the centroid of an area for common structural shapes. For a more comprehensive discussion on the center of gravity, the center of mass, calculating centroids using integration, and distributed loads, see the Engineering Statics book by Baker and Haynes.\nThe location of the centroid of an area is the point where the first moment of area equals zero. The first moment of area about a point is calculated by multiplying the area by the perpendicular distance to the point. The centroid of an area can be found by splitting the area into a number (i) of discrete parts, summing the moment of area for these discrete parts, and then dividing by the sum of the area. We can use these weighted averages to find the location \\((\\bar{X}, \\bar{Y})\\) of the centroid of the area:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n&\\bar{X}=\\frac{\\sum \\bar{x}_i A_i}{\\sum A_i} \\\\\n\\\\\n&\\bar{Y}=\\frac{\\sum \\bar{y}_i A_i}{\\sum A_i}\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\tag{8.1}\\]\nwhere\n\\(\\bar{X}, \\bar{Y}\\) = Centroid coordinates of the overall area [m, in.]\n\\(\\bar{x}_i, \\bar{y}_i\\) = Centroid coordinates of each discrete area [m, in.]\n\\(A_i\\) = Area of each discrete area [m2, in.2]\nWe can find centroids of simple shapes easily by utilizing symmetry. When a shape possesses an axis of symmetry, each point on one side of the axis corresponds to another point symmetrically located on the opposite side. The distances between these mirrored points and the line of symmetry will sum to zero because they will be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. This is true for every point in the shape, so the numerator of Equation 8.1 (the first moment of area) will be zero. Therefore, if a shape features a line of symmetry, its centroid must coincide with this line. In cases where a shape exhibits multiple lines of symmetry, the centroid is located at their intersection, as shown in Figure 8.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Centroids lie upon axes of symmetry.\n\n\n\nIn this text, we will use common shapes or a composite of common shapes for our cross-sections. Appendix E includes the location of the centroid of some common shapes. Part of Appendix E is reproduced in Figure 8.3. Each row of the table includes a common shape with the centroid marked, and simple formulas for determining the x- and y-coordinates of the centroid and calculating the area of the shape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Reproduction of one of the shapes in Appendix E. Appendix E includes a sketch of the area with the centroid marked, formulas for determining the x- and y-coordinates of the centroid, and a formula for calculating the area of the shape.\n\n\n\nOften, structural sections are combinations of these standard shapes called composite sections. As long as we know the location of the centroid of each shape that comprises the section, we will not need to use integration to find the location of the overall sections’ centroid. We can use Equation 8.1 in conjunction with the table in Appendix E to find the location of the centroid for composite shapes.\nExample 8.1, Example 8.2, and Example 8.3 demonstrate the process for determing the centroid coordinates of composite areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.1  \n\n\nFind the centroid of the shape below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this T-section, we notice that it is symmetric about the y-axis. This means we will not need to calculate the centroid in the x direction because we know it will be on that y-axis. We only need to find the distance in the y direction, \\(\\bar{Y}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing we need to do is establish a coordinate system where the origin is our reference point, RP. In this example we chose the bottom left corner of the section so that all of our y distances will be positive.\nWe then divide the section into simpler shapes where we know the location of the centroid. In this case we chose two rectangles, labeled 1 and 2 in the figure.\n\n\n\nShape\n\\(A{~(in.^2)}\\)\n\\(\\bar{y}{~(in.)}\\)\n\\(A\\bar{y}{~(in.^3)}\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\n13.5\n2.25\n30.375\n\n\n2\n13.5\n5.25\n70.875\n\n\n\n\\(\\sum A\\)=27\n\n\\(\\sum A\\bar{y}\\)=101.25\n\n\n\nNext, we will create a table with columns titled Shape, \\(A\\) (in.2), \\(\\bar{y}\\) (in.), and \\(A\\bar{y}\\) (in.3). We have two shapes so there will be two rows in our table. The first column, Area, is the area of the individual shape. The second column, \\(\\bar{y}\\), is the perpendicular distance in the y-direction from the RP to the centroid of that shape. For example, for shape 1 the \\(\\bar{y_1}\\) would be half of 4.5 inches since the bottom of shape 1 aligns with the RP. However, for shape 2 the \\(\\bar{y_2}\\) would be 4.5 inches plus one half of 1.5 inches. This is because we need to ensure that we are measuring from the RP as illustrated below.\n\\[\n\\bar{Y}=\\frac{101.25{~in.^3}}{27{~in.^2}}=3.75{~in.} ~~\\text{from bottom}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to calculate the centroid coordinates, we will utilize Equation 8.1 by summing the last column and the second column in our table. We found the centroid to be 3.75 inches from the reference point in the y-direction and on the line of symmetry in the x-direction. The figure below show the location of the centroid for this T section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.2  \n\n\nFind the centroid of the shape below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this section, we notice that it is symmetric about the y-axis, similar to Example 8.1. This means that we will not need to calculate the centroid in the x direction because we know it will be on that y-axis. We only need to find the distance in the y direction, \\(\\bar{Y}\\).\nThe first thing we need to do is establish a coordinate system whose origin is our reference point, RP. In this example, we chose the bottom of the section along the y-axis so that all of our y distances will be positive.\nWe then divide the section into simpler shapes for which we know the centroid’s location. In this case, we chose three rectangles labeled 1, 2, and 3 in the figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will create a table with columns titled Shape, \\(A\\) (mm2), \\(\\bar{y}\\) (mm), and \\(A\\bar{y}\\) (mm3). We have three shapes, so there will be three rows. The first column, Area, is the area of the individual shape. The second column, \\(\\bar{y}\\), is the perpendicular distance in the y-direction from the RP to the centroid of that shape. The figure below shows how the \\(\\bar{y}\\) for each shape is calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind centroid (x̄=0 due to symmetry).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShape\n\\(A{~(mm^2)}\\)\n\\(\\bar{y}{~(mm)}\\)\n\\(A\\bar{y}{~(mm^3)}\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\n4,000\n20\n80,000\n\n\n2\n2,800\n110\n308,000\n\n\n3\n7,200\n200\n1,440,000\n\n\n\n\\(\\sum A\\)=14,000\n\n\\(\\sum A\\bar{y}\\)=1,828,000\n\n\n\nFinally, to calculate the centroid coordinates, we will utilize Equation 8.1 by summing the second and last columns in our table.\n\\[\n\\bar{Y}=\\frac{1,828,000{~mm^3}}{14,000{~mm^2}}=130.6{~mm} ~~\\text{from bottom}\n\\]\nWe found the centroid to be 130.6 mm from the reference point in the y-direction and on the line of symmetry in the x-direction. The figure below shows the location of the centroid for this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.3  \n\n\nFind the centroid of the shape below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section does not have any axis of symmetry, so we will need to find both the \\(\\bar{x}\\) and the \\(\\bar{y}\\). We first need to establish a coordinate system whose origin is our reference point, RP. In this example, we will use the coordinate axis in the problem to illustrate when \\(\\bar{x}\\) will be negative.\nWe then divide the section into simpler shapes for which we know the centroid’s location. In this case, we will break this up into the square, triangle, and circle labeled 1, 2, and 3 in the figure. Note that the circle is a hole, and the area will be represented as negative.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will create a table with columns titled Shape, \\(A\\) (in2), \\(\\bar{x}\\) (in), \\(\\bar{y}\\) (in), and \\(A\\bar{y}\\) (in3). We have three shapes so there will be three rows. The first column, Area, is the area of the individual shape. The second column, \\(\\bar{x}\\), is the perpendicular distance in the x-direction from the RP to the centroid of that shape. The figure below shows how the \\(\\bar{x}\\) for each shape is calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure below shows how the \\(\\bar{y}\\) for each shape is calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to calculate the centroid coordinates, we will utilize Equation 8.1 by summing the Area, \\(A\\bar{x}\\), and \\(A\\bar{y}\\) columns see the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShape\nShape\n\\(A{~(in.^2)}\\)\n\\(\\bar{x}{~(in.)}\\)\n\\(A\\bar{x}{~(in.^3)}\\)\n\\(\\bar{y}{~(in.)}\\)\n\\(A\\bar{y}{~(in.^3)}\\)\n\n\n\n1\n64\n-4\n-256\n4\n256\n\n\n\n2\n24\n2\n48\n(2/3)(8) = 16/3\n128\n\n\n\n3\n-4π\n-4\n-16π\n4\n-16π\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sum A\\)=75.4\n\n\\(\\sum A\\bar{x}\\)=-258.3\n\n\\(\\sum A\\bar{y}\\)=333.7\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\bar{X}=\\frac{\\sum A \\bar{x}}{\\sum A}=\\frac{-258.3{~in.^3}}{75.4{~in.^2}} \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad \\bar{X}=-3.43{~in} \\\\\n& \\bar{Y}=\\frac{\\sum A \\bar{y}}{\\sum A}=\\frac{333.7{~in.^3}}{75.4{~in.^2}} \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad \\bar{Y}=4.43 \\mathrm{in}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe found the centroid to be -3.43 inches in the x-direction from the reference point, this indicates that the centroid will be to the left of the y-axis. The y-component of the centroid is 4.43 inches in the y-direction from the reference point. The figure below shows the location of the centroid for this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Finding the Centroid of Composite Sections\n\n\n\nTo find the location of the centroid of a composite section where the location of the centroid is known for each part of the composite section, use the following procedure:\n\nEstablish a coordinate axis where the origin is the reference point (RP). This will be where the centroid will be measured.\nBreak the overall section up into simpler shapes where the location of the centroid of each shape is known. It is helpful here to sketch this. If the section has a hole, include the hole as a shape with a negative area. Remember to take advantage of symmetry. If the overall section is symmetric about an axis, you already know the location of the centroid in that direction as it is on that axis.\nDetermine the Area (A), the perpendicular distance from the y-axis (\\(\\bar{x}\\)), and the perpendicular distance from the x-axis (\\(\\bar{y}\\)) to the centroid of each shape. As sections become more complex, it might be advantageous to arrange these values in tabular form (see examples in this section).\nApply Equation 8.1 to find the overall section’s centroid, (\\(\\bar{X}, \\bar{Y}\\)). Remember that this location is measured from the RP you established in step 1.\nCheck that your answer is reasonable. Imagine any straight line that passes through the centroid. There should be an equal amount of area on each side of this line. Mark the centroid location on the composite area and check that this appears roughly accurate.",

Similar to calculating centroids we will break these composite sections into common shapes and find the moment of inertia of these individual shapes.  When we calculate each individual shape’s moment of inertia, we need to ensure that they are all about the same axis. The parallel axis theorem provides a method for calculating the moment of inertia of an area about an axis parallel to an axis passing through the centroid, given that the moment of inertia about the latter axis is known.\nTo establish the parallel axis theorem, we will examine the moment of inertia I of an area A relative to an axis x, as illustrated in Figure 8.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: The moment of inertia of an area A about an axis x can be derived from its moment of inertia about the centroidal axis x’ through a computation involving the distance dy between the axes.\n\n\n\nThe centroid of the area is at C, where the x’-y’ axis is drawn; note that x’ is parallel to x and y’ is parallel to y. The x-y’ axes will be termed the centroidal axes and a distance of dx and dy from the x-y axes, respectively. The distance between the element dA and the x’-axis is denoted as y’. Now we have \\(y=y^{\\prime}+d_y\\). Substituting into Equation 8.2, we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I_x=\\int\\left(y^{\\prime}+d_y\\right)^2 d A \\\\\n& I_x=\\int\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)^2 d A+2 d_y \\int y^{\\prime} d A+d_y^2 \\int d A\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe first integral represents the moment of inertia about the centroidal axis x’. The second integral is zero since the centroid is located on the x’ axis (i.e., \\(\\int y^{\\prime} d A\\) represents the first moment of area about the x’ centroidal axis, which is zero as discussed in Section 8.1). The last integral represents the total area, A. So we have:\n\\[\n\\boxed{I_x=\\overline{I_{x^{\\prime}}}+A d_y^2}\n\\tag{8.3}\\]\nA similar process is used to find an expression for Iy:\n\\[\n\\boxed{I_y=\\overline{I_{y^{\\prime}}}+A d_x^2}\n\\tag{8.4}\\]\nwhere\nIx, Iy = the moment of inertia of an area with respect to a given axis [m4, in.4]\n\\(\\overline{I_{x^{\\prime}}}\\) , \\(\\overline{I_{y^{\\prime}}}\\) = moment of inertia of that area with respect to a parallel axis passing through the centroid of the area [m4, in.4]\nA = area [m2, in.2]\ndx, dy = perpendicular distance between the given axis and the parallel centroidal axis [m, in.]\nWhile the parallel axis theorem can be used to calculate the area moment of inertia around any pair of axes, we will primarily focus on calculating the area moment of inertia around the centroidal axes of a composite area. It is this term which will be used in Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 when calculating bending stresses and shear stresses. Example 8.4, Example 8.5, and Example 8.6 demonstrate the use of the parallel axis theorem to find the area moments of inertia for the composite areas from the earlier examples about their centroidal axes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8.4  \n\n\nDetermine the Ix the shaded area with respect to the section’s centroid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we want to find the moment of inertia in the x direction with respect to the section’s centroid, we first need to calculate the centroid.

    "text": "9.1 Bending Stress\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nThis section will discuss bending behavior of straight, symmetric, homogeneous beams. This section will be limited to beams that have a cross section that is symmetric with an axis and the bending moment is around an axis that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. Examine the initially unaltered beam depicted in Figure 9.2, characterized by a rectangular cross-section, and annotated with both horizontal and vertical grid lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: An unloaded beam with a rectangular cross-section.\n\n\n\nUpon the application of a bending moment, the tendency emerges to deform these lines, conforming to the pattern illustrated in Figure 9.3. Observe the curvature of the horizontal lines, and note that the vertical lines, while maintaining straightness, undergo a rotation. The application of a bending moment induces stretching in the material at the bottom section of the bar and compression in the material at the top section. As a result, within the transitional zone between these two regions, there exists a surface known as the neutral surface, where the horizontal fibers of the material experience no change in length (no compression or tension). When viewed on a cross-section, the neutral surface appears as a horizontal line known as the neutral axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: The deformation of the beam in Figure 9.2 when subjected to a symmetric bending moment.\n\n\n\nWe can make a similar observation when a kids toy undergoes bending as shown in Figure 9.4. This toy is subjected to a bending moment in the opposite direction of the beam in Figure 9.3, this will switch the behavior of the top and the bottom surfaces. Notice in Figure 9.4 the fibers at the top are pulled apart while the bottom surface fibers are pushed together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: The distortion of a kid’s toy when undergoing bending.\n\n\n\nWe can take this knowledge about deformations due to bending and apply it to the failure of the column in Figure 9.5. Notice that the column was fixed at the base and was subjected to a transverse force that caused failure. The fibers on the right side of the column failure point were pulled apart while the fibers on the left side of the column failure point were compressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Column failure due to bending.\n\n\n\nWe will make the following assumptions about deformations due to bending:\n\nThere must be a neutral surface parallel to both the upper and lower surfaces, where the length remains constant.\nThroughout the deformation, all cross sections of the beam remain plan and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis.\nThe cross section will keep it’s shape, we will ignore the Poisson effects discussed in Section 4.4 of this text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: Element in beam bending.\n\n\n\nTo understand bending stress in a beam subjected to arbitrary loads, examine a small element extracted from the beam in Figure 9.6. The derivation of the bending strain equation remains unaffected by the beam type or specific loads. Remember the fundamental definition of normal strain:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\delta}{L}\n\\]\nWe can use this to calculate the normal strain along AB in our beam.\n\\[\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\overline{A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}}-\\overline{A B}}{\\overline{A B}}\n\\]\nDistance y is measured relative to the neutral surface and is positive above the neutral surface and negative below. Prior to bending, the line AB is the same length at all values of y. However, when bending occurs, the length of A’B’ varies. The length A’B’ experiences a reduction in length as the section moves farther above the neutral surface, and conversely, it undergoes an increasing extension below the neutral surface. By definition, the length of the neutral surface doesn’t change and remains the same as length AB. We can describe the lengths AB and A’B’ using the radius of curvature (ρ) and the differential angle (dθ) shown in Figure 9.6.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\overline{A B}=\\rho d \\theta \\\\\n\\overline{A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}}=(\\rho-y) d \\theta\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nWe can now substitute these lengths into our strain equation:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{(\\rho-y) d \\theta-\\rho d \\theta}{\\rho d \\theta}\n\\]\nSimplifying\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{\\rho d \\theta-y d \\theta-\\rho d \\theta}{\\rho d \\theta} \\\\\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{-y d \\theta}{\\rho d \\theta} \\\\\n\\varepsilon=-\\frac{y}{\\rho}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nThis relationship shows us that the longitudinal strain, ε, varies lineraly with the distance, y, from the neutral surface. The maximum stress occurs at the outermost fibers, extreme top and bottom of the section. We call this maximum distance from the netrual surface, c. We can now write a relationship for the maximum absolute value of the strain, εm.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\varepsilon_{\\max }}=-\\frac{y / \\rho}{c / \\rho} \\\\\n\\varepsilon=-\\left(\\frac{y}{c}\\right) \\varepsilon_{\\max }\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nAssuming that our material behaves in a linearly elastic manner, we can use Hooke’s Law, \\(\\sigma = E \\epsilon\\), to rewrite the strain relationship above into a relationship of stresses:\n\\[\n\\sigma=-\\left(\\frac{y}{c}\\right) \\sigma_{\\max }\n\\]\nTherefore, similar to the variation in normal strain, normal stress, σ, will fluctuate from zero at the neutral surface to a maximum value, σmax, at a distance c from the neutral surface as shown in Figure 9.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Bending stress variation.\n\n\n\nTo determine the position of the neutral surface, we necessitate the condition where the resultant force generated by the stress distribution across the cross-sectional area is equal to zero.\n\\[\n0=\\int_A F_{resultant}=\\int_A \\sigma d A\n\\]\nWe can now substitute our previous relationship between stress and distance from neutral axis.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 0=\\int_A-\\left(\\frac{y}{c}\\right) \\sigma_{\\max } d A \\\\\n& 0=-\\frac{\\sigma_{\\max }}{c} \\int_A y d A\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince \\(-\\frac{\\sigma_{\\max }}{c}\\) does not equal zero we are left with:\n\\[\n0=\\int_A y d A\n\\]\nThis integral represents the first moment of area, as discussed in Section 8.1. This equation indicates that the first moment of the cross-section about its neutral axis must be zero. Recall that the location of the centroid was determined by \\(\\bar{y}=\\frac{\\int_A y d A}{A}\\). Consequently, for a member experiencing pure bending and as long as the stresses remain within the elastic range, the neutral axis traverses through the centroid of the section since \\(\\bar{y}\\) (the distance from the neutral axis to the centroid) is zero.\nWe can ascertain the stress in the beam by setting the moment M equal to the moment produced by the stress distribution around the neutral axis.\n\\[\nd M=y d F\n\\]\nSince\n\\[\nd F=\\sigma d A\n\\]\nWe can write\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nM=\\int_A y d F=\\int_A y(\\sigma d A)=\\int_A y\\left(-\\frac{y}{c} \\sigma_{\\max }\\right) d A \\\\\nM=\\frac{\\sigma_{\\max }}{c} \\int_A y^2 d A\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nYou might notice that the integral, \\(\\int_A y^2 d A\\), represents the moment of inertia, or second moment of area, of the cross-sectional area about the neutral axis. We will denote the moment of inertia with I, as in Section 8.2.\nRearranging the previous equation to obtain the flexure formula:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma_{\\max }=\\frac{M c}{I}}\n\\tag{9.1}\\]\nwhere\nσmax = Maximum bending stress in the beam, note that a complete description includes magnitude, units, tension, or compression [Pa, psi]\nM = Internal bending moment calculated about the neutral axis of the cross section, determined from method of sections or shear and moment diagrams [N·m, lb·in.]\nc = Perpendicular distance from the neutral axis to the point the farthest away from the neutral axis [m, in.]\nI = Area moment of inertia about the neutral axis [m4, in.4]\nWe know from previous derivation that:\n\\[\n\\sigma=-\\left(\\frac{y}{c}\\right) \\sigma_{\\max }\n\\]\nwe can rearrange to provide the following relationship:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sigma_{\\max }}{c}=-\\frac{\\sigma}{y}\n\\]\nWe can determine a similar flexure formula to calculate the bending stress at any point along the cross section:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma=-\\frac{M y}{I}}\n\\tag{9.2}\\]\nwhere\nσ = Bending stress [Pa, psi]\nM = Internal moment calculated about the neutral axis of the cross section [N·m, lb·in.]\ny = Perpendicular distance from the neutral axis to the point of interest [m, in.]\nI = Area moment of inertia about the neutral axis [m4, in.4]\nSimilar to Chapter 2, when reporting normal stress you include if that stress is in tension or compression. During the derivation, we used a beam that was bending concave upwards. In Chapter 7 we indicated that this type of moment was considered positive. This leads to compression above the neutral axis and tension below. The inverse is true when the beam is subjected to negative bending moment as shown in Figure 9.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.8: Bending stress sign convention.\n\n\n\nExample 9.1 and Example 9.2 demonstrate the calculation of bending stresses at vrarious points on a cross-section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.1  \n\n\nA beam with the shown cross section is subjected to a positive moment of 50 k-in. Calculate the normal stress at the top, bottom, and interface between flange and web.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first start with the internal moment, this is a given in the problem statement to be +50k-in. Positive moment indicates that the beam is bending concave up, compression above the neutral axis and tension below.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe next need to determine the beam properties—centroid and moment of inertia. Since this is not a standard shape and the shape is not symmetric in the y direction, we will need to calculate this by hand.

The magnitude is 1.31, the units will be kips/in2 or ksi. To determine the tension or compression we will look at the sign of the internal moment and where along the section we are calculating the bending stress. In our example the moment is positive, and we calculate the stress at the top of the section our answer will be in compression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_{top}=1.31{~ksi}~(C)\n\\]\nNote that, as long as we are careful to use the correct signs for M and y (both positive in this case), the answer will also come out with the correct sign (negative in this case which indicates compression).\nWe will now calculate the normal stress at the bottom of the beam. The only quantity that changes is the y value – we will now use the distance from the neutral axis to the bottom of the beam (3.75 in).\n\\[\n\\sigma_{btm}=-\\frac{(50{~kip}\\cdot{in.})(-3.75{~in.})}{86.0625{~in.}^4}=2.18{~ksi}\n\\]\nThe moment is positive, so the beam bends concave up, anything below the neutral axis is in tension.\n\\[\n\\sigma_{btm}=2.18{~ksi}~(T)\n\\]\nThis again works mathematically as long as we use the correct positive sign for the M and negative sign for y (since the point of interest is below the neutral axis). The answer comes out positive, indicating tension and matching our expectation.\nFinally, we can calculate the normal stress at the junction of the flange and the web. We will need to find the distance from the neutral axis the flange web junction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_{F / w}=-\\frac{(50{~kip}\\cdot{in.})(0.75{~in.})}{86.0625{~in.}^4}=-0.436{~ksi}\n\\]\nSince the flange web junction is above the neutral axis and our beam is subjected to positive moment, our bending stress will be in compression.\n\\[\n\\sigma_{F/w}=0.436{~ksi}~(C)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.2  \n\n\nCalculate the maximum tensile and maximum compressive bending stress in the beam shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to find the internal forces in the beam so that we can find the maximum positive and negative moments.

The negative bending moment will cause tension at the top and compression at the bottom. It’s not obvious by inspection which of these two tensile stresses will be larger, nor which of the two compressive stresses will be larger. We should calculate all four to compare.\nBefore we plug in our values, we need to ensure that the units are consistent so we will change everything to Newtons and meters.\n\nMpos = 37.125 kN·m = 37.125 x 103 N·m\nMneg = 30 kN·m = 30 x 103 N·m\nytop = 89.43 mm = 0.08943 m\nybtm = 130.57 mm = 0.13057 m\nIx = 90,862,095 mm4 = 90.862095 x 10-6 m4\n\nWe will start with calculating the stress at the top and bottom of the section due to the maximum positive moment, using the flexure formula:\n\\[ \\sigma=-\\frac{M y}{I} \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{top/pos}=-\\frac{\\left(37.125 \\times 10^3{~N}\\cdot{m}\\right)(0.0893 {~m})}{90.86 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^4}=-36.49{~MPa~(C)} \\]\n\\[ \\sigma_{btm/pos}=-\\frac{\\left(37.125\\times10^3{~N}\\cdot{m}\\right)(-0.13057{~m})}{90.86 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^4}=53.35{~MPa}{~(T)} \\]\nNow we can do something similar for the maximum negative bending stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{top/neg}=-\\frac{\\left(-30 \\times 10^3{~N}\\cdot{m}\\right)(0.0893{~m})}{90.86 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^4}=29.48{~MPa~(T)} \\]\n\\[ \\sigma_{btm/neg}=-\\frac{\\left(-30 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{~N}\\cdot{m}\\right)(-0.13057{~m})}{90.86 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^4}=-43.11{~MPa}~{(C)} \\]\nThe overall maximum tensile stress for this beam occurs at the bottom of the section due to positive moment, 53.35 MPa (T). The overall maximum compressive stress (43.11 MPa (C)) also occurs at the bottom of the section in a different part of the beam, but is due to the negative moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many situations the overall largest stress would be sufficient. However, there are materials that behave differently depending on whether they are subjected to tensile or compressive stress. Concrete is a good example of this, as it is relatively strong against compressive stresses but very weak against tensile stresses. Steel rebar is placed inside concrete members to support the tensile stresses as shown in Figure 9.9. At this point in your engineering career it is good practice to report both the maximum tensile and compressive stresses at each critical point on the beam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.9: The end of the prestressed concrete beam showing the prestressing steel and rebar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Calculating Bending Stress\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the internal moment at the point to which you want to calculate the bending stress.

    "section": "9.2 Beam Design for Bending",
    "text": "9.2 Beam Design for Bending\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nFrequently, beam design is governed by the bending moment. In this section, we will leverage our understanding of bending stress to design beams capable of withstanding their applied internal moments. We will design two common categories of beams. We’ll start with rolled steel beams of varying cross sections. You can find a sampling of these standard shapes in Appendix A of this text. We’ll then discuss rectangular cross-sections, which are common for timber beams.\nA safe design requires that the allowable stress of the material used is greater than the stress due to the loading. When we design a structure, we need to know what the material properties are so that we can produce safe designs. In the flexure equation for maximum bending stress, \\(\\sigma_m=\\frac{M_{\\max } c}{I}\\), there are four variables: σm, Mmax, c, and I. We will start with the allowable stress of the material, σall, and use the |Mmax| derived from the loading condition. What is left are section properties, I, and c. For standard shapes these are combined into one variable, section modulus (S):\n\\[\n\\boxed{S=\\frac{I}{c}}\n\\tag{9.3}\\]\nWe can substitute this value into the flexure formula and rearrange for Smin—the minimum allowable value of the section modulus for the beam:\n\\[\n\\boxed{S_{min}=\\frac{\\left|M_{\\max}\\right|}{\\sigma_{allow}}}\n\\tag{9.4}\\]\nwhere\nSmin = Minimum required section modulus for the beam to resist the bending stress [m3, in.3]\n|Mmax| = Magintude of the maximum internal bending moment [N·m, lb·in.]\n𝜎allow = Maximum allowable stress for the beam [Pa, psi]\n\n9.2.1 Design of Standard Steel Sections\nAs long as we design our beam such that its section modulus is larger than Smin, the beam is guaranteed not to fail due to bending stress. Rolled steel beams tend to have relatively complex cross-sections with multiple dimensions that can be varied in order to alter its section modulus and therefore its resistance to bending stress. Designing each dimension individually would be time consuming and it would be costly to manufacture a unique beam for every loading condition. Instead, beams are mass produced in standard sizes and engineers simply select the most appropriate beam for their specific need. There will be many standard steel shapes that will satisfy this equation, meaning they will be safe. Engineering is determining which of the shapes that work you will use. Often there are many criteria that you will need to consider. In this section we will use cost to determine the shape. Steel beams are priced by their weight, the higher the weight the more expensive. To choose the most economical shape, we will choose the shape with the smallest weight (smallest cross-sectional area).\nThere are basic structural steel shapes that have standardized cross sectional dimensions. W shapes (standing for Wide Flange) are often used for beam design as they have an efficient cross section. Figure 9.10 is a sample of the beam table in Appendix A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.10: Portion of the W Section table from Appendix A\n\n\n\nEach beam has a designation that gives us quick information about the section, see Figure 9.11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.11: Description of the Shape designation in U.S. Customary Units.\n\n\n\nNotice in the sample beam section table in Figure 9.10 they are all W shapes and grouped by approximate height (first number). Within each height grouping the shapes are arranged from lightest to heaviest (second number) when going from the bottom to top of the height grouping. For each standard shape in this table the cross-sectional area, depth (height), flange and web dimensions, moment of inertia in the x and y directions, section modulus, in the x and y direction, and the radius of gyration in the x and y directions (this is a geometric property related to buckling, we will use this in Chapter 15 of this text) are given.\nIn certain instances, the selection of a section might be constrained by factors such as the permissible depth of the cross-section or the allowable deflection of the beam. This discussion is limited to materials that behave the same in tension and compression. If this is not the case (such as when you use concrete), then you may need to check multiple points along the length of the beam. Additionally, if the section is not symmetric about the neutral axis, the maximum tensile and compressive stresses may not occur at the point where M is max or min. Lastly, this procedure only considers bending stresses. Although bending stresses do control the design of most beams, there are instances where shear or deflection will control. We will discuss this more in Chapter 11 in this text.\nExample 9.3 designs a wide-flange beam to resist bending stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.3  \n\n\nKnowing that the allowable normal stress for the steel used is 24 ksi, select the most economical wide-flange beam to support the loading shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to find the internal forces in the beam, we will start by calculating the reactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum& F_x =A_x =0\\\\\n\\sum& M_A =-8{~kips}(5{~ft})+5{~kips}(11{~ft})-(3\\frac{kips}{ft}*6{~ft})(17{~ft})+B_y(20{~ft})=0 \\\\\n&B_y =14.55{~kips} \\\\\n\\sum& F_y=A_y-8{~kips}+5{~kips}-(3\\frac{kips}{ft})*6{~ft})+14.55{~kips}=0 \\\\\n&A_y=6.45{~kips}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow that we have the reactions, we can build the shear diagram. We will start on the left side and go up the reaction at support A, 6.45 kips. We will continue along the beam following the loads to finish the shear diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo build the moment diagram we will calculate the area under the curve from the shear diagram using geometry. We will calculate the area of three rectangles and two triangles.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& A_1=(6.45)(5)=32.25 \\\\\n& A_2=(1.55)(6)=9.3 \\\\\n& A_3=(3.45)(3)=10.35 \\\\\n& \\frac{18}{6}=\\frac{3.45}{x} \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad x=1.15{~ft,}~~~y=6-1.15=4.85 {~ft} \\\\\n& A_4=\\frac{1}{2}(1.15)(3.45)=1.98 \\\\\n& A_5=\\frac{1}{2}(4.85)(1455)=35.28 \\\\\n&\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFrom the moment diagram we can see that |Mmax| = 35.28 kip*ft. We will use this value and σall = 24 ksi (given in the problem statement) to calculate the minimum section modulus needed, Smin.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S_{min}=\\frac{|M_{max}|}{\\sigma_{allow}} \\\\\n& S_{min}=\\frac{(35.28{~kip}\\cdot{ft})(12\\frac{in.}{ft})}{24{~ksi}} \\\\\n& S_{min}=17.64{~in}^3\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow that we know the minimum section modulus needed for this beam, we will go to the standard beam table in Appendix A. Focusing on the Sx column, we will start at the bottom of the table and choose one shape from each height section that is applicable.\nFor our beam, the following sections will be adequate for bending:\n\nW8 x 21\nW10 x 19\nW12 x 22\nW14 x 22\n\nWe didn’t choose any from the W4, W5, and W6 groupings because none of these beams have a section modulus greater than 17.64 in3. We also didn’t continue with groupings greater than W14 because those sections are far larger than what we need as noted by the weight (second number in the designation).\nNow we will choose the most economical beam by comparing the last number in the designation, as this represents the weight per foot of the beam. The most economical section for this material and loading is the W10 x 19. This beam weighs 19 lb/ft and is the lightest of the beams we identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Most Economical Beam Design (standard shapes)\n\n\n\n\nEstablish the allowable stress, σall, value of sigma for the chosen material by referring to a table of material properties or consulting design specifications. Proceed with the following steps assuming that σall is the same for tension and compression.\nDetermine the maximum absolute value of the bending moment |Mmax| in the beam by drawing the shear force and bending moment diagrams. (Review of this is in Chapter 7 of this text).\nCalculate the minimum allowable value of the section modulus using this equation: \\(S_{min}=\\frac{\\left|M_{\\max }\\right|}{\\sigma_{all}}\\)\nFor a rolled steel beam, refer to the relevant table in Appendix A. Among the accessible beam sections, focus solely on those with a section modulus surpassing the minimum value calculated in step 3, S ≥ Smin. Start at the bottom of the table and select one beam in each height section (if applicable). Then from this short list, choose the section with the smallest weight per unit length, as it represents the most economical option for which S ≥ Smin. It’s essential to note that this choice may not necessarily correspond to the section with the smallest S value.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Design of Rectangular Sections\nRectangular cross-sections are common for timber beams. There are only two dimensions that need to be specified, base and height. While there are standard rectangular cross-sections too (e.g., 2” x 4”) we’ll approach the design of rectangular cross-sections by assuming that one dimension scales with the other and so we only need to specify a single dimension. Rather than select from a list of standard cross-sections, we’ll specify this required dimension exactly.\nWe can calculate the minimum section modulus as before\n\\[\nS_{min}=\\frac{\\left|M_{max}\\right|}{\\sigma_{allow}}\n\\]\nNow set this value\n\\[\nS_{min}=\\frac{I}{c}\n\\]\nFor a rectangle\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nI=\\frac{b h^3}{12} \\\\\nc=\\frac{h}{2}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nSo\n\\[\nS_{min}=\\frac{I}{c}=\\frac{2 b h^3}{12 h}=\\frac{b h^2}{6}\n\\]\nProblems will be set up such that there is a relationship between b and h, which leaves only one unknown that can be solved for directly. This will be the minimum acceptable size for this dimension—anything larger than the calculated value will not fail due to bending stress.\nExample 9.4 designs a wooden beam with a rectangular cross-section to resist bending stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.4  \n\n\nA simply supported timber beam spans a gap of 10 m. It is subjected to a uniform distributed load w = 15 kN/m as shown. The beam has a rectangular cross-section and will be manufactured such that the height is 2x the base. Determine the minimum acceptable dimensions for the cross-section of this beam if the maximum allowable bending stress of the timber is 12 MPa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe allowable stress is given as σall = 12 MPa. Determine the magnitude of the maximum internal bending moment by drawing the shear force and bending moment diagrams. Since the loading is symmetric, the total applied load of 15 * 10 = 150 kN will be split evenly between the two supports. The reaction force at each support will be 75 kN.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe magnitude of the maximum internal bending moment |Mmax| = 187.5 kN·m\nNow we can determine the required section modulus. Be careful with the order of magnitude of the bending moment and allowable stress.\n\\[\nS_{min}=\\frac{187.5\\times10^3{~N}\\cdot{m}}{12\\times10^6\\frac{N}{m^2}}=0.015625{~m}^3\n\\]\nWe can use this value to determine the required dimensions of the cross-section. Recall that h = 2b for this beam.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nS_{min}=0.015625{~m^3}=\\frac{b h^2}{6}=\\frac{b(2 b)^2}{6}=\\frac{4 b^3}{6}=\\frac{2}{3} b^3 \\\\\nb^2=\\frac{3}{2} * 0.015625{~m^3}=0.0234375{~m^3} \\\\\nb=~^3\\sqrt{0.0234375}=0.286{~m} \\\\\nb=286{~mm} \\\\\nh=2b=2 * 286=572{~mm}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nThe minimum required dimensions to ensure this beam doesn’t fail due to bending stress are b = 286 mm and h = 572 mm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this text, it is appropriate to give exact answers to 3 significant figures. In practice we wouldn’t generally specify the required dimension down to the mm since this is unnecessarily precise to manufacture. It is more practical to design to perhaps the nearest 10 mm, remembering to always round up. For example, we calculated the required dimension b = 153 mm. We must not round this down to 150 mm as this are below the required value, but rounding up to 160 mm would be acceptable. While not included in this problem, there would also be a factor of safety (Section 4.8) included in all designs in practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Most Economical Beam Design (rectangular sections)\n\n\n\n\nEstablish the allowable stress, σall, value of sigma for the chosen material by referring to a table of material properties or consulting design specifications.

    "section": "9.3 Unsymmetric Bending—Moment Arbitrarily Applied",
    "text": "9.3 Unsymmetric Bending—Moment Arbitrarily Applied\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nOccasionally, a member may experience loading where the bending moment, M, does not align with one of the principal axes of the cross-section. In such cases, it is advisable to initially resolve the moment into components along the principal axes. Subsequently, the flexure formula can be applied to ascertain the normal stress induced by each moment component. Finally, by employing the principle of superposition, the resultant normal stress at the specific point can be determined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.12: Moment arbitrarily applied to a rectangular cross section.\n\n\n\nTo systematize this process, envision a beam with a rectangular cross-section subjected to a moment, M, as depicted in Figure 9.12 (A). Here, M forms an angle, θ, with the maximum principal z-axis, which is the axis of maximum moment of inertia for the cross-section. It is assumed that θ is positive when directed from the positive z-axis towards the positive y-axis. We can resolve M into y and z components:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& M_z=M \\cos \\theta \\\\\n& M_y=M \\sin \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can see in Figure 9.12 (B) the components of M acting on the rectangular cross section. It is important to keep track of which side of the beam is in compression and tension when subjected to both Mz and My. We will use tensile stress as positive and compressive stress as negative. When we look at a +Mz we can see that this moment causes the top of the section to be in compression and the bottom of the section to be in tension. When we inspect the section when subjected to +My, we can see that the left side will be in tension while the right side will be in compression. Combining what we know about the sign convention with the flexure formula we can calculate the resultant normal stress at any point on the cross section using the following equation:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma=-\\frac{M_z y}{I_z}+\\frac{M_y z}{I_y}}\n\\tag{9.5}\\]\nwhere\n𝜎 = Bending stress at point of interest [Pa, psi]\nMz, My = Internal bending moment components about the z- and y-axes [N·m, lb·in.]\ny, z = Distance in the y- and z-directions from the centroid to the point of interest [m, in.]\nIz, Iy = Area moment of inertia about the centroidal z- and y-axes [m4, in.4]\nNote that for the signs to work correctly we must assign the appropriate sign to the y and z values and to the components of the bending moment. These values are measured from the coordinate system that originates at the centroid where the x axis is coming out of the page. You can also ignore all of the signs and use your spatial awareness to determine if each term is in tension or compression due to the applied moment.\nPreviously we identified the neutral axis—a line marking points of zero stress, When the bending moment acted around the horizontal axis, the neutral axis was also horizontal and passed through the centroid of the cross-section. When the bending moment acts at an angle (θ) from the horizontal axis, the neutral axis will still pass through the centroid but it will not be horizontal. It too will be at an angle (α). We can now determine the orientation of the neutral axis, as this will commonly not coincide with the axis of bending moment. We can derive the orientation of the neutral axis by setting the previous normal stress equation equal to zero:\n\\[\n0=-\\frac{M_z y}{I_z}+\\frac{M_y z}{I_y}\n\\]\nNow we can rearrange this to solve for y.\n\\[\ny=\\frac{M_y I_z}{M_z I_y} z\n\\]\nNow we can put this equation in terms of M by using \\(M_z=M \\cos \\theta\\) and \\(M_y=M \\sin \\theta\\) to obtain:\n\\[\ny=\\left(\\frac{I_z}{I_y} \\tan \\theta\\right) z\n\\]\nSince the slope of the line is \\(\\tan \\alpha=y / z\\) where the angle α represents the angle the neutral axis forms with the z axis, this can be written as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{tan(\\alpha)=\\left(\\frac{I_z}{I_y}tan~\\theta\\right)}\n\\tag{9.6}\\]\nwhere\n𝛼 = Orientation of the neutral axis, measured from the z-axis [\\(^\\circ\\)C, \\(^\\circ\\)F]\n𝜃 = Orientation of the internal bending moment, measured from the z-axis [\\(^\\circ\\)C, \\(^\\circ\\)F]\nIz, Iy = Area moment of inertia about the centroidal z- and y-axes [m4, in.4]\nExample 9.5 and Example 9.6 demonstrate how to calculate bendign stress at various points on a cross-section when the moment is arbitrarily applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.5  \n\n\nA bending moment M = 400 kip⸱in. is applied around an axis 65° above the negative z-axis as shown.

Assuming that the material is homogenous and linear elastic, the flexure formula can be used to calculate the normal stresses.

We start the design process in this chapter by using the allowable stress and maximum moment to determine the minimum section modulus. This minimum section modulus is used to choose an adequate, economical beam shape. We will discuss future chapters additional criteria to design a beam.\nWhen a member experiences loading where the bending moment, M, does not align with one of the principal axes of the cross-section, a method of super position is used to determine the resultant normal stress at a specific point.

    "text": "10.1 The First Moment of Area\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nShear stress in an object depends on the internal shear force and the shape of the cross-section. One important geometric property used in this chapter is the first moment of area. This property was introduced in Section 8.1 and was used when determining the centroid of an area. Recall we used @eqn-8.2 to break simple cross-sections down into a number of composite parts. When finding the centroid of these composite areas we modified the equation slightly to:\n\\[\n\\bar{y}=\\frac{\\sum y_i A_i}{\\sum A_i}=\\frac{y_1 A_1+y_2 A_2+\\ldots}{A_1+A_2+\\ldots}\n\\]\nWe can rewrite this equation in its integral form:\n\\[\n\\bar{y}=\\frac{\\int y d A}{\\int d A}\n\\]\nThe numerator in this equation is the first moment of area. It will be given the symbol Q.\n\\[\nQ=\\int y d A\n\\]\nSimilarly, for the purposes of this text we can write:\n\\[\n\\boxed{Q=\\sum y_i A_i=y_1 A_1+y_2 A_2+\\ldots}\n\\tag{10.1}\\]\nwhere\nQ = First moment of area [m3, in.3]\ny = Vertical distance from neutral axis to centroid of area A [m, in.]\nA = Area above (or below) point of interest [m2, in.2]\nIn Section 8.1 we performed this calculation relative to some convenient reference axis in order to determine the location of the centroid of an area (such as in Example 8.3). Ai represents the area of each composite part and yi represents the distance from the reference axis to the centroid of each composite part.\nThe first moment of area can actually be calculated around any axis. The maximum value will always occur at the centroid of the cross-section (i.e., the neutral axis) so many problems will involve finding the first moment of area at the neutral axis, but there are also cases where finding the first moment of area around some other axis is required. Note that the axis should be perpendicular to the shear force, so a vertical load requires us to use a horizontal axis.\nTo calculate the first moment of area around an axis, first draw a line through this axis. We may choose to use either the area above this axis or the area below it, whichever is simpler. The answer will be the same either way. Break this area down into composite parts (if necessary) and apply \\(Q=\\sum y_i A_i\\) where Ai is the area of each composite part and yi is the perpendicular distance between the centroid of the overall cross-section and the centroid of each composite part. Note that we must first find the location of the centroid of the overall cross-section in order to measure this distance.\nExample 10.1 demonstrates this process to find the first moment of area around the neutral axis of a T cross-section. This example is solved twice, once using the area below the neutral axis and once using the area above.\nExample 10.2 uses the same cross-section and demonstrates calculating the first moment of area around a different axis on the cross-section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.1  \n\n\nA beam has the T-shaped cross-section shown. Determine the first moment of area around the neutral axis of the cross-section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst determine the y-coordinate of the centroid of the cross-section. Consider the area as two rectangles and use the method of Section 8.1. We will choose a reference point at the bottom of the section to calculate the centroid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y_1=4.5{~in.}~,~ A_1=18{~in.}^2 \\\\\n& y_2=10.5{~in.}~,~ A_2=30{~in.}^2 \\\\\n& \\bar{y}=\\frac{(4.5{~in.} * 18{~in.}^2)+(10.5{~in.} * 30{~in.}^2)}{18{~in.}^2+30{~in.}^2}=8.25{~in.}~~\\text{from the bottom of the section (our reference point) }\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that since this section is simple, only two shapes, we didn’t create a table as we did in Section 8.1. This is a simplified version of the table, but the calculation is exactly the same.\nNow draw a horizontal line through the point of interest. In this case the point of interest is the neutral axis. Use either the area above this line or the area below this line to determine the first moment of area around the neutral axis. We’ll solve it both ways to demonstrate that we get the same answer either way.\nArea below the neutral axis:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis area is a simple rectangle. Recall that Q=yA where A is the area of the rectangle and y is the vertical distance between the neutral axis and the centroid of the rectangle.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y=\\frac{8.25{~in.}}{2}=4.125{~in.}  \\\\\n& A=8.25{~in.} * 2{~in.}=16.5{~in} ^2 \\\\\n& Q=y A=4.125{~in.} * 16.5{~in.}^2=68.1{~in.}^3\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nArea above the neutral axis:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis area can be split into two rectangles. Here we’ll use \\(Q=\\sum y_i A_i=y_1 A_1+y_2 A_2\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y_1=\\frac{0.75{~in.}}{2}=0.375{~in.} \\\\\n& A_1=0.75{~in.} * 2{~in.}=1.5{~in.}^2 \\\\\n& y_2=0.75{~in.}+1.5{~in.}=2.25{~in.} \\\\\n& A_2=10{~in.} * 3{~in.}=30{~in.}^2 \\\\\n& Q=(0.375{~in.} * 1.5{~in.}^2)+(2.25{~in.} * 30{~in.}^2)=68.1{~in}^3\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhether we use the area above the neutral axis or the area below the neutral axis, we get the same answer of Q=68.1 in3. We may choose to use whichever area seems simpler to work with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.2  \n\n\nThe T-shaped cross-section from Example 10.1 is repeated here. Determine the first moment of area around an axis passing through the interface between the flange and web.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to first determine the y-coordinate of the centroid of the cross section. We did this in Example 10.1, the results are shown below.\n\\(\\bar{y}=8.25{~in.}\\) from the bottom of the cross-section.\nNow draw a horizontal line through the point of interest. In this case the point of interest is the seam between the two boards. As demonstrated in Example 10.1, we may use either the area below this line or the area above this line to determine the first moment of area.\nArea above the line:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis area is a simple rectangle. Recall that Q=yA where A is the area of the rectangle and y is the vertical distance between the neutral axis and the centroid of the rectangle. Note that the perpendicular distance is always measured to the neutral axis, not to the seam between the two boards.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y=0.75{~in.}+1.5{~in.}=2.25{~in.} \\\\\n& A=10{~in.} * 3{~in.}=30{~in.}^2 \\\\\n& Q=y A=2.25{~in.} * 30{~in.}^2=67.5{~in.}^3\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAs an additional exercise, try using the area below the seam between the two boards to calculate Q=67.5 in.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple cross-sections such as rectangles and circles are fairly commonly used for beams. For these simple cross-sections we can derive standard solutions for the maximum first moment of area (Qmax). Recall that this always occurs at the neutral axis of the cross-section.\nFor a rectangle of base b and height h (Figure 10.2), the neutral axis will be at \\(y=\\frac{h}{2}\\). Drawing a line along the neutral axis and taking the area above this line gives \\(A=b \\frac{h}{2}\\). The distance between the centroid of this area and the neutral axis of the cross-section will be \\(y=\\frac{h}{4}\\). Thus, for a rectangular cross-section:\n\\[\nQ_{\\max }=\\frac{h}{4} \\frac{b h}{2}=\\frac{b h^2}{8}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Determining the first moment of area around the neutral axis of a rectangular cross-section.\n\n\n\nFor a circular cross-section of radius r (Figure 10.3), the area above the neutral axis is semi-circle so \\(A=\\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2\\). The distance from the centroid of the semi-circle to the neutral axis is \\(y=\\frac{4 r}{3 \\pi}\\). Thus, for a circular cross-section:\n\\[\nQ_{\\max }=\\frac{4 r}{3 \\pi} \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2=\\frac{2}{3} r^3\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Determining the first moment of area around the neutral axis of a circular cross-section.\n\n\n\nNote that both of these are only for finding the first moment of area at the neutral axis (Qmax). If the first moment of area around any other axis is required, these shortcuts will not work, and the general process will need to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n\n\n\nLocate the centroid of the cross-section.\nDraw a line through the cross-section perpendicular to the internal shear force.

    "section": "10.2 Shear Stress",
    "text": "10.2 Shear Stress\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nIn Section 2.2 we learned about average shear stress:\n\\[\n\\tau_{avg}=\\frac{V}{A}\n\\]\nThis is the average shear stress on a cross-section, but shear stress actually varies along the section (Figure 10.4). For a vertical internal shear force, shear stress is zero at the top and bottom of a cross-section and maximum at the neutral axis. Shear stress varies in a parabolic fashion. The average shear stress does not provide a full picture and it is often necessary to calculate the shear stress at a specific point on the cross-section instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: Parabolic variation in shear stress over a cross-section. For a vertical shear force on a uniform cross-section, the shear stress is zero at the top and bottom of the section and maximum at the neutral axis.\n\n\n\nTo derive the shear stress formula, we’ll begin by examining a small 2D element on a body subjected to an internal shear force (Figure 10.5). If this element is in equilibrium, a shear force applied to one face of this element must also produce shear forces (and therefore shear stresses) on the other faces of the element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: Element A on the beam is subjected to shear force V on the right side. For the element to be in equilibrium there must also be an equal and opposite force V on the other side. However, this element will rotate so there must be two additional forces to create an equal moment in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\nThus, an element experiencing a vertical shear stress also experiences a horizontal shear stress. This is known as the complementary property of shear. This effect can be seen by forming a ‘beam’ out of a stack of paper and applying a vertical force. The pieces of paper slide horizontally relative to each other (Figure 10.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.6: A stack of papers representing a beam. The ends of the beam are initially vertical. Load F is applied, creating an internal vertical shear force. The papers slide relative to each other horizontally, indicating that there must also be a horizontal shear force created.\n\n\n\nAnother example is a wooden beam that fails due to shear. In such beams, cracks tend to appear horizontally even though the applied load is vertical. This is due to horizontal shear stress between the layers of the wood (Figure 10.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.7: Horizontal shear failure in a wooden beam subjected to a vertical load.\n\n\n\nImagine a beam subjected to an arbitrary vertical load. Consider a small cross-section of width Δx (Figure 10.8). This cross-section is subjected to an external load, an internal shear force on each side of the cross-section, and an internal bending moment on each side of the cross-section. The two shear forces and two bending moments are not necessarily equal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.8: Internal loads on a small cross-section of width Δx on a beam subjected to an arbitrary vertical load, w = f(x). The internal loads on the right side of the section are slightly larger than those on the left.\n\n\n\nBy considering horizontal equilibrium, we do not need to account for the vertical loads (V, V + ΔV, and w). The bending moments (M and M + ΔM) will create horizontal stresses (Figure 10.9) equal to\n\\[\n\\sigma_{x 1}=\\frac{M y}{I}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\sigma_{x 2}=\\frac{(M+\\Delta M) y}{I}\n\\]\nSince \\(F=\\sigma A\\), we can determine the total force applied by each bending moment:\n\\[\nF_1=\\int \\frac{M y}{I} d A\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nF_2=\\int \\frac{(M+\\Delta M) y}{I} d A\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.9: Horizontal stresses created by moments M and (M + ΔM).\n\n\n\nEach force is tensile in part of the beam and compressive in part of the beam. When calculated across the entire cross-section these forces will sum to zero. However, if we consider only part of the cross-section the forces do not sum to zero (Figure 10.10). For the beam to be in equilibrium, there must be a horizontal shear force. For now we’ll call this force F’ and derive an equation for the shear stress it creates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.10: Forces F1 and F2 do not balance when considering only part of the element. There must be an additional internal shear force F’.\n\n\n\nBy equilibrium:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum F_x=F^{\\prime}+\\int \\frac{M y}{I} d A-\\int \\frac{(M+\\Delta M) y}{I} d A=0 \\\\\n& F^{\\prime}=-\\int \\frac{M y}{I} d A+\\int \\frac{M y}{I} d A+\\int \\frac{\\Delta M y}{I} d A \\\\\n& F^{\\prime}=\\int \\frac{\\Delta M y}{I} d A=\\frac{\\Delta M}{I} \\int y d A\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nOnce the constants are taken out of the integral, the remaining integral is just the first moment of area, Q.\n\\[\nF^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\Delta M}{I} Q\n\\]\nWe can calculate the shear stress from \\(\\tau=\\frac{V}{A}\\) where V = F’ and A is the area of the cross-section that force F’ acts on. This area will be width, Δx, multiplied by the thickness of the beam, t.\n\\[\n\\tau=\\frac{V}{A}=\\frac{F^{\\prime}}{\\Delta x t}=\\frac{\\Delta M Q}{\\Delta x I t}\n\\]\nFrom Section 7.2 we know that the change in moment with respect to x is equal to the shear force, V\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta M}{\\Delta x}=V \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\tau=\\frac{VQ}{It}}\n\\tag{10.2}\\]\nwhere\nτ = Shear stress at a point on the cross-section [Pa, psi]\nV = Internal shear force at the cross-section [N, lb]\nQ = 1st moment of area at the point of interest on the cross-section [m3, in.3]\nI = Area moment of inertia of the cross-section [m4, in.4]\nt = thickness of the cross-section [m, in.]\nThis is the shear stress equation, allowing us to calculate the shear stress at any point on a cross-section. This is often more useful than simply calculating the average shear stress across the entire cross-section.\nExample 10.3 demonstrates calculation of the maximum shear stress in a simply supported beam with a circular cross-section.\nExample 10.4 demonstrates how to calculate the maximum stress is a cross-section of varying thickness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.3  \n\n\nA simply supported beam with the circular cross-section shown is subjected to a uniformly distributed load w = 30 kN/m across its entire length L = 8 m. Determine the maximum shear stress that occurs in the beam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shear stress can be calculated from \\(\\tau=\\frac{V Q}{I t}\\). The maximum shear stress will occur when V and Q are at their maximum values.\nThe maximum shear force, Vmax, can be found by drawing a shear force diagram. Start with a free body diagram of the beam and use this to sketch the shear force diagram using the graphical method of Section 7.4. The loading and supports are symmetric, so each support will resist half of the applied load.\n\\[\nA=B=\\frac{w L}{2}=\\frac{30\\frac{kN}{m} * 8{~m}}{2}=120{~kN}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the diagram it is apparent that the maximum shear force in the beam, Vmax = 120 kN. This occurs at the supports.\nThe area moment of inertia for the circular cross-section is given by\n\\[\nI=\\frac{\\pi}{4} r^4=\\frac{\\pi}{4}(0.02{~m})^4=1.257 \\times 10^{-7}{~m}^4\n\\]\nThe maximum first moment of area, Qmax, occurs at the neutral axis of the cross-section.

    "text": "10.3 Shear Flow\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nSome cross-sections are formed by connecting multiple pieces together with fasteners such as nails or bolts (Figure 10.11). In such members, we must analyze not only the stresses in the cross-section itself but also the stresses in the fasteners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.11: T cross-section formed by connecting two boards together with nails. There is a consistent spacing s between nails along the length of the beam.\n\n\n\nA useful quantity in this regard is shear flow, q. Shear flow measures of how much shear force is applied per unit length of the beam, and it is measured in units of force/length [N/m, lb/in.]. For example, if a nail is capable of resisting a shear force up to 10 kN and there is a shear flow of 30 kN/m, it is trivial to determine that we need at least 3 nails for every meter of beam.\nRecall from Section 10.2 that the internal horizontal shear force, F’, may be written as\n\\[\nF^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\Delta M}{I} Q\n\\]\nDividing both sides by Δx\n\\[\n\\frac{F^{\\prime}}{\\Delta x}=\\frac{\\Delta M Q}{\\Delta x I}\n\\]\nSimilar to our derivation in the previous section, we may replace \\(\\frac{\\Delta M}{\\Delta x}=V\\). We may also replace \\(\\frac{F^{\\prime}}{\\Delta x}=q\\).\n\\[\nq=\\frac{V Q}{I}\n\\]\nThis equation is very similar to the shear stress equation, but the thickness of the cross-section doesn’t appear here as shear flow is measured per unit length. We will generally want to determine the shear flow at the seam where the individual pieces of the cross-section are joined together as this is where the fasteners must resist the horizontal shear force.\nOften we want to determine how far apart we can space the nails along the length of the beam. Since shear flow is the shear force per unit length, if we know how much shear force each fastener can resist, we can say that the shear flow is equal to the force resisted by each fastener (Fnail) divided by the spacing between the fasteners (s). Sometimes there will be multiple rows of nails side-by-side (Figure 10.12). In this case we can multiply the force resisted by each fastener by the number of rows (r).\n\\[\n\\boxed{q=\\frac{V Q}{I}=\\frac{F_{nail} r}{s}}\n\\tag{10.3}\\]\nwhere\nq = Shear flow at a line on the cross-section [N/m, lb/in.]\nV = Internal shear force at the cross-section [N, lb]\nQ = 1st moment of area at the point of interest on the cross-section [m3, in.3]\nI = Area moment of inertia of the cross-section [m4, in4]\nFnail = Horizontal shear force resisted by each nail [N, lb]\nr = Number of rows of nails resisting the shear force\ns = Spacing between nails [m, in.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.12: T cross-section held together by two rows of nails. The rows are spaced evenly along the length of the beam by distance s.\n\n\n\nSometimes fasteners may be placed horizontally (Figure 10.13). In these cases we should still draw a line along the seam perpendicular to the fastener (so vertically in this case). We can then use the area either to the left or right of this line to determine the first moment of area. Note that we still use the vertical distance between the centroid of our chosen area and the neutral axis of the cross-section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.13: A horizontal fastener requires a vertical line along the seam and the selection of the area either to the left or right of this line. When calculating the first moment of area by Q = yA, the distance y is still in the vertical direction.\n\n\n\nExample 10.5 works through a problem with two rows of nails at each seam.\nExample 10.6 involves an L-beam with a horizontal nail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.5  \n\n\nA beam is made by nailing together three boards to form the cross-section shown. At each connection, two rows of nails are used to secure the boards. Each nail can resist a horizontal shearing force of 1,500 N. If the beam is subjected to an internal vertical shear force of 4,500 N, determine the minimum required spacing, s, between the rows of nails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to determine the shear flow at one of the points where the beams are connected. Use \\(q=\\frac{V Q}{I}\\) where V = 4,500 N. Since the section is symmetric, we can determine the location of the centroid by inspection, \\(\\bar{y}=160 \\mathrm{~mm}\\) from the top and bottom. Now we need to determine the area moment of inertia, I, for the cross-section.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy considering the area as a large rectangle with two smaller rectangles cut out:\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nI=\\frac{140 * 320^3}{12}-2\\left(\\frac{45 * 200^3}{12}\\right)=322.3 \\times 10^6{~mm}^4=322.3 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^4\n\\]\nNext draw a line through the point of interest (along the seam where the nails are holding the boards together) and determine the first moment of area, Q, at this line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nQ=y A=130{~mm} *(60{~mm} * 140{~mm})=1092 \\times 10^3{~mm}^3=1,092 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^3\n\\]\nShear flow:\n\\[\nq=\\frac{V Q}{I}=\\frac{4500 {~N}* 1092 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^3}{322.3 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^4}=15,247~\\frac{N}{m}\n\\]\nFinally, set the shear flow, \\(q=\\frac{F_{nail} r}{s}\\), and solve for the spacing, s:\n\\[\ns=\\frac{F_{nail} r}{q}=\\frac{1500{~N} * 2}{15247~\\frac{N}{m}}=0.197 \\mathrm{~m}=197 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.6  \n\n\nA beam is formed by nailing two boards together to form the L-shaped cross-section shown.

It can be calculated along any axis. Generally, the internal shear force is vertical, and so the first moment of area is calculated around a horizontal axis. The maximum first moment of area will occur around the neutral axis of the cross-section.\nShear stress varies in a parabolic manner across the cross-section. For a vertical shear force it is zero at the top and bottom of the section. For a uniform cross-section, the maximum shear stress occurs at the neutral axis as this is where the largest first moment of area is. If the cross-section varies in thickness, the maximum shear stress may not be at the neutral axis since the shear stress increases as the thickness of the cross-section decreases.\nShear flow is a measure of the shear force over a unit length. It is useful when creating a cross-section by fastening two or more individual pieces together. The shear flow can be used to determine the maximum allowable spacing between the fasteners in order to ensure the fasteners do not break.

    "text": "Click to expand\n\nWe now know how to calculate both the bending stress (Chapter 9) and shear stress (Chapter 10) in a beam. In this chapter we’ll consider the deformation of a beam subjected to bending and shear stresses. Under load, beams deflect from their original position (Figure 11.1). Some amount of deflection is unavoidable, but it is usually desirable to limit deflection as much as possible. Although deflection often doesn’t pose a safety risk (unless the allowable stress of the beam is also exceeded) too much deflection can render a beam unfit for purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: A model bridge showing severe deflection along its span (left). Although the bridge hasn’t broken, there is too much deflection for the application. The deflection in a hockey stick during a shot (right). In this application the deflection is helpful as it stores and releases energy during the shot.\n\n\n\nIdealized sketches showing the shape of the deflected beam are a helpful visual aid. This deflected shape is known as the elastic curve (Figure 11.2). Sketches of the elastic curve provide a quick visual reference of how the beam will deflect and can be used to check that our numerical answers are realistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Two example beams showing the undeflected position of the centerline (dotted line) and the deflected position of the elastic curve (solid line).\n\n\n\nIn Section 5.3 we learned to calculate deformation due to axial load \\(\\left(\\Delta L=\\frac{F L}{A E}\\right)\\). In Section 6.2 we learned to calculate deformation due to torsional load \\(\\left(\\varnothing=\\frac{T L}{J G}\\right)\\). Note that both types of deformation depend on:\n\nApplied/internal load (F, T)\nLength of the object (L)\nCross-section geometry (A, J)\nMaterial properties (E, G)\n\nIt is probably not surprising then that beam deflection also depends on these four things. We’ll study two common techniques for calculating deflection: The method of integration (Section 11.1 and Section 11.2) and the method of superposition (Section 11.3). Being able to calculate deflection is vitally important, as it allows us to predict how much a beam will deflect before we build a structure. Once we’re able to calculate deflection, we’ll use this to help solve some more statically indeterminate problems (Section 11.4). Finally, in Section 11.5, we’ll build on our beam design work of Section 9.2 by expanding our specifications to include limitations on not just bending stress, but shear stress and deflection as well.",

    "text": "11.1 Integration of the Moment Equation\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nWe’ll begin by deriving an equation for calculating the deflection at any point in a loaded beam. In Section 9.1, we derived equations relating to bending strain and bending stress:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon=-\\frac{y}{\\rho}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma=-\\frac{My}{I}\n\\]\nApplying Hooke’s Law to the strain equation gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\varepsilon=-\\frac{y}{\\rho}&=\\frac{\\sigma}{E} \\\\\n\\sigma&=-\\frac{Ey}{\\rho}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSet the two stress equations equal:\n\\[\n\\frac{E y}{\\rho}=\\frac{M y}{I}\n\\]\nRearrange:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\rho}=\\frac{M(x)}{E I}\n\\]\nThe radius of curvature (ρ) can be related to the deflection (y) by the equation\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\rho}=\\frac{\\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}}}{\\left[1+\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)^{2}\\right]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\n\\]\nThis equation describes the exact deflection \\((y)\\) at any distance \\((x)\\) along the beam. In most engineering applications the deflection \\((y)\\) is very small. We can simplify this equation significantly by assuming that our deflection \\((y)\\) will be small and thus that \\(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\) is very small and \\(\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}\\) is negligible. This simplifies the equation to\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\rho}=\\frac{\\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}}}{[1+0]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}=\\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}}\n\\]\nFinally\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\rho}=\\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}}=\\frac{M(x)}{E I}\n\\]\nTo solve for deflection we can first find an equation for the internal bending moment as a function of \\((x)\\), using equilibrium just as we did in Section 7.3 for drawing the bending moment diagram. We can then set this equation equal to \\(E I \\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}\\) and integrate twice.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{gathered}\nM(x)=E I \\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}} \\\\\n\\int M(x) d x+C 1=E I \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\iint M(x) d x+C 1 x+C 2=E I y\n\\end{gathered}}\n\\tag{11.1}\\]\nIn these equations, \\(y\\) represents the deflection of the beam and \\(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\) represents the slope of the deflected beam. Since the equations are functions of \\(x\\), we can find the slope and deflection at any point along the beam.\nNote that each successive integral introduces a constant of integration which we must solve for. We do this through the use of boundary conditions—that is, points on the beam where we already know the slope and/or deflection. The most common boundary conditions for our applications will be:\n\nAt any support the deflection \\((y)\\) is zero\nAt a fixed support the slope \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)\\) is zero\n\nFigure 11.3 illustrates these boundary conditions. Once the constants of integration are known, we can define equations for the slope and deflection of the beam in terms of distance \\((x)\\) along the beam and calculate the slope and deflection at any value of \\(x\\). See Example 11.1 and Example 11.2 to see this process applied to a simply supported beam and a cantilever beam respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: At pin and roller supports, the deflection is zero but the slope is not. At a fixed support, both the slope and deflection are zero.

We must find separate moment equations for each loading region and integrate each separately.

Note that in this example we will need to determine 2 internal bending moment equations and integrate each equation twice, thereby introducing four constants of integration. Two of these can still be determined by using boundary conditions, but we still need to determine the other two. This is done with continuity conditions.\nEquation set 1 describes the internal moment, slope, and deflection of the beam from point A to point B, and equation set 2 describes the internal moment, slope, and deflection from point B to point C.

In some cases it may be easier to make one cut from the left and the other from the right. Consider the simple beam in Figure 11.4. When making a cut in the region not under the distributed load, a free body diagram to the left of the cut has many more forces than a free body diagram of the right side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Simple beam showing two options for finding the internal bending moment. Note that the moment equation will be much simpler if we draw the right hand side of the cut.\n\n\n\nThe moment equation will be much simpler if we draw the right hand side of the cut. This in turn simplifies the integrations and the math involved in finding the constants of integration. We must however make one change to our continuity conditions if we measure distance x2 from the right. When making both cuts from the left we said that at point C the slope and deflection from calculated from equation 1 must be the same as those calculated from equation 2.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)_{1} & =\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)_{2} \\\\\ny_{1} & =y_{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhen measuring distance x2 from the right, it is still true at point C that [math] as the deflection is still downwards regardless of whether we measure our horizontal distance from the left or right. The magnitude of the slope will also be the same at point C regardless of which equation we use to calculate it. However, the direction of rotation of the slope will change from counter-clockwise to clockwise due to us changing the coordinate system (Figure 11.5). Thus our second boundary condition must become\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)_{1}=-\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)_{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Depending on which side of the cut we draw, the deflection at point C will have the same magnitude and direction. The slope at point C will have the same magnitude but opposite directions if we make one cut from the left and the other from the right.\n\n\n\nThis negative sign is vitally important, and we will not get the correct answer if we forget to include it.

    "text": "11.2 Integration of the Load Equation\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nIn Section 11.1 we used equilibrium equations to determine the internal bending moment in a beam as a function of x. We related this bending moment to the deflection by\n\\[\nM(x)=E I \\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}\n\\]\nIn Section 7.2 we learned that there is a relationship between the internal bending moment, the internal shear force, and the external load. For an external distributed load, w, we found\n\\[\nV=\\int_{0}^{L} w(x) d x\n\\]\n\\[\nM=\\int_{0}^{L} V(x) d x\n\\]\nWe may therefore relate the deflection of a beam to not only the internal bending moment, but also the internal shear force and external distributed load through successive integrations. For some loading configurations it can be much simpler to integrate the distributed load equation 4 times instead of finding the equation of the internal bending moment through equilibrium and integrating twice. When doing this, remember that loads acting downwards (as most loads on beams do) are negative.\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n&w(x)=E I \\frac{d^{4} y}{d x^{4}} \\\\\n&V(x)=E I \\frac{d^{3} y}{d x^{3}}=\\int w(x) d x+C 1 \\\\\n&M(x)=E I \\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}=\\int V(x) d x+C 2 \\\\\n&\\theta(x)=E I \\frac{d y}{d x}=\\int M(x) d x+C 3 \\\\\n&y(x)=\\int \\theta(x) d x+C 4\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\tag{11.2}\\]\nNote that each successive integral will introduce a new constant of integration. We must again apply boundary conditions in order to solve for these constants. There are now four constants so we require four boundary conditions. Two of these are the same as in Section 11.1:\n\nAt any support the deflection is 0\nAt a fixed support, both the slope and deflection are zero\n\nThe other two boundary conditions come from knowing the value of the shear force and bending moment at a point in the beam. We are able to find these from our work in Chapter 7. While we can use known values at any point in the beam, it is generally easiest to use the shear force and bending moment at x = 0. At this point:\n\nThe shear force will be equal to the applied force (including a force applied by a support) if there is one, or zero otherwise.\nThe bending moment will be equal to the applied moment (including a moment applied by a fixed support) if there is one, or zero otherwise.\n\nSee Example 11.4 for a demonstration of how to find the deflection of a beam by integrating the load equation. Note that while this method can be used for any beam, it is best applied to beams with a single continuous distributed load acting over the length of the beam. Beams with discontinuous loading will require integration of multiple load equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.4  \n\n\nThe cantilever beam from Example 11.2 is repeated here.

    "text": "11.3 Superposition\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nIt should be apparent from the previous sections that finding deflection using the method of integration can become quite complicated and time-consuming if there are multiple loads. In such cases, the method of superposition is a good alternative.\nBeams are typically loaded in a relatively small number of standard configurations, and the deflection behavior of a beam subjected to one of these standard loads is very well understood. A subset of beam deflections have been included in Appendix B. Figure 11.6 shows an example of the information provided for one such beam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: Appendix B contains some standard loading configurations along with a sketch of the elastic curve, equations for the maximum deflection and maximum slope, and the general equation of the elastic curve.\n\n\n\nThis can be useful even for more complex loading. When multiple loads act on a beam, the effect of each load on the deflection of the beam may be considered independently. Thus, even for loading more complex than the loads in Appendix B, it may be possible to simplify the problem by considering each load separately and calculating the deflection caused at a point by each load (Figure 11.7). These deflections can then be added together to find the overall deflection at that point. We must of course calculate the deflection at the same point for each load in order to add them together. See Example 11.5 for a demonstration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: Although Appendix B doesn’t contain a cantilever beam with both a distributed load and a concentrated load, it does contain cantilever beams with each load separately.

    "text": "11.4 Statically Indeterminate Deflection\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nA problem is statically indeterminate if there are more unknown support reactions than there are equilibrium equations to solve for them. We have seen statically indeterminate problems in Section 5.5 and Section 6.3. In both sections we used a similar method to solve statically indeterminate problems where we took advantage of our knowledge of deformation in order to solve for one of the reaction forces before using equilibrium equations to find the others. We’ll do something similar here. We may use either an integration method similar to that of Section 11.1 or a superposition method similar to that of Section 11.3.\nIn practice, engineers design structures with redundancies so that if one part fails it can be replaced without the entire structure collapsing. As such, static indeterminacy is the norm.\nIn Section 11.1 we cut a cross-section and found the internal bending moment as a function of x, M = f(x). We integrated this twice to determine the equation of the elastic curve. For statically indeterminate problems, we will write our moment equation as a function of both x and A, where A is the unknown force at the redundant support. After integrating this equation twice we will have three unknowns, but also three boundary conditions. We will therefore be able to solve for the redundant reaction force and then use equilibrium equations to solve for the other reactions. See Example 11.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.6  \n\n\nA propped cantilever beam of length L = 6 ft is subjected to a linear distributed load where w0 = 20 kips/ft.

We can solve \\(\\sum F_x=0\\) to find \\(B_x = 0\\), but that still leaves us with 3 unknowns and 2 equations.\n\n\n\n\n\nCut a cross-section and determine the internal bending moment in terms of distance x and redundant force Ay.

While it can be used for more complex loads, it quickly becomes complicated and time consuming. For these problems it is generally better to use superposition.\nThe method is very similar to the methods used to solve other statically indeterminate problems in Section 5.5 and Section 6.3. To solve a statically indeterminate deflection problem using superposition, first identify the redundant support. We have 3 equilibrium equations and so can solve for three unknown support reactions. Any support reactions beyond this are redundant. Remove the redundant reaction and determine the deflection due to the applied loads at the point that the reaction was removed. It is best to remove a support such that the remaining beam is either simply supported or cantilever as these are the only support configuration in Appendix B.\nThen replace the redundant reaction and determine the deflection due to this reaction and the point that the reaction is applied. Since there is actually a support here, the total deflection must be zero. Sum both deflections and set them equal to zero. This will allow you to calculate the value of the redundant support. Once this is known the other reaction loads can be determined using equilibrium. See Example 11.7 for a demonstration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.7  \n\n\nThe propped cantilever beam of Example 11.6 is shown again here.

In this case, determining the deflection at the point that the load was removed isn’t helpful as removing the moment reaction from a fixed support effectively leaves a pin support and the deflection with the moment removed will still be zero. In this situation we can instead look at the slope at the point that the reaction was removed. Example 11.7 is repeated below with the moment at B removed instead of the force at A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.7 (reworked)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe propped cantilever beam of Example 11.6 is shown again here. If length L = 6 ft is subjected to a linear distributed load where w0 = 20 kips/ft. Determine the reactions at supports A and B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time we’ll remove the moment reaction at B to leave a simply supported beam.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding the deflection at B would not help as it would simply be zero. Instead, use Appendix B to find the slope at B.\n\\[\n\\theta_B=\\frac{W_0 L^3}{45 E I}\n\\]\nNow replace the moment reaction at B and use Appendix B to find the slope at B due to this moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\theta_B=-\\frac{M_B L}{3 E I}\n\\]\nSince there is actually a fixed support at B, the slope here must be zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} &\\frac{W_0 L^3}{45 E I}-\\frac{M_{B L}}{3 E I}=0 \\\\ &M_B  =\\frac{W_0 L^2}{15}\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAdding numbers we get:\n\\[\nM_B=\\frac{20~\\frac{kips}{ft}*(6{~ft})^2}{15}=48{~kip}\\cdot{ft}\n\\]\nWhich is the same answer we found in Example 11.6.

In such cases, remove all redundant reactions and determine the deflection due to the external loads at every point that a reaction was removed. Then replace the redundant reactions one at a time and determine the deflection due to each load at every point that a reaction was removed. As before, the total deflection at each of these points must be zero. Sum the deflection at each point and set it equal to zero. There will be one equation for every redundant reaction and so all redundant reactions can be calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Statically Indeterminate Deflection\n\n\n\n\nIdentify and remove redundant reaction(s).\nDetermine the deflection at the point that the reaction was removed. Use superposition if possible, or integration otherwise.\n\nIf the removed reaction was a couple, determine the slope at this point instead.\n\nReplace the redundant reaction and determine the deflection caused by this load at the point that the load acts.\n\nIf the removed reaction was a couple, determine the slope at this point instead.\n\nThese deflections (or slopes) must add up to the total deflection at this point. This is typically zero due to the support unless indicated otherwise. Use this to determine the magnitude of the redundant reaction.\nUse equilibrium to solve for the other reactions. Then solve for anything else required as normal.",

    "text": "11.5 Intermediate Beam design\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nIn Section 9.2 we learned how to use the section modulus to design a beam to meet bending stress specifications. In practice, beams must also meet specifications for shear stress and deflection. Limitations will be placed on all three of these criteria and we must design our beams to meet all three simultaneously. We’ll begin with rectangular cross-sections and then move on to W beams.\nAs in Section 9.2, problems involving rectangular cross-sections will typically relate the base and height of the cross-section such that we only need to determine one dimension. Previously we designed the cross-section to resist bending stress using:\n\\[\nS_{\\min }=\\frac{M_{\\max }}{\\sigma_{allow}}=\\frac{I}{c}\n\\]\nSince \\(I=\\frac{b h^{3}}{12}\\) and \\(c=\\frac{h}{2}\\) we were able to determine the required dimensions to meet the minimum required section modulus. The equation \\(S=\\frac{I}{c}\\) will simplify to \\(S=\\frac{\\frac{b h^{3}}{12}}{\\frac{h}{2}}=\\frac{2 b h^{3}}{12 h}=\\frac{b h^{2}}{6}\\) for a rectangle.\nTo meet the minimum required shear stress we will use \\(\\tau=\\frac{V Q}{I t}\\). Using the method of Section 10.1, it can be shown for a rectangle (Figure 11.8) that \\(Q=y A=\\frac{h}{4} \\frac{b h}{2}=\\frac{b h^{2}}{8}\\). Since \\(I=\\frac{b h^{3}}{12}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{t}=\\mathrm{b}\\), we can re-write the shear stress equation to find the maximum shear stress in a rectangular cross-section as \\(\\tau_{\\max }=\\frac{V \\frac{b h^{2}}{8}}{\\frac{b h^{3}}{12} b}=\\frac{12 V b h^{2}}{8 b^{2} h^{3}}=\\frac{12 V}{8 b h}=\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{V}{A}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.8: Rectangular cross-section showing the dimensions used for calculating the section modulus (S) and first moment of area (Q).\n\n\n\nThus we may set \\(\\tau_{\\max }=\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{V}{A}\\) and solve for the required dimensions to not exceed the maximum allowable shear stress.\nThe maximum deflection of the beam under a given loading configuration can be found using the methods of this chapter. Wherever possible, use superposition and Appendix B. If it is not possible to use Appendix B then the method of integration can be used instead. In either case the equation for the maximum deflection of the beam will include the area moment of inertia, I. Set the maximum allowable deflection equal to this equation and replace \\(I=\\frac{b h^{3}}{12}\\). We can then solve for the required dimensions of the cross-section to not exceed the maximum allowable deflection of the beam.\nWe now have three different dimensions—one required to not exceed the maximum bending stress, one required to not exceed the maximum shear stress, and one required to not exceed the maximum deflection. Since we must not exceed any of these limitation, we select the largest of our three potential answers.

Use \\(S_{\\min }=\\frac{M_{\\max }}{\\sigma_{allow}}\\) and select a beam with \\(\\mathrm{S}&gt;\\mathrm{S}_{\\min }\\).\nNext determine the equation for the maximum deflection of the beam under the given loading conditions. As before, use superposition and Appendix C whenever possible. Set the maximum allowable deflection equal to this equation and solve for the minimum required area moment of inertia, \\(I_{\\min }\\). Now select the lightest beam from Appendix A that meets both \\(S_{\\min }\\) and \\(I_{\\min }\\).\nSteel W beams rarely fail due to shear stress, but shear must still be checked. An exact value for the maximum shear stress in the beam can be found from \\(\\tau_{\\max }=\\frac{V Q}{I t}\\). However, most of the shear stress is resisted by the web of the beam. A reasonable estimate of the maximum shear stress can be found using \\(\\tau_{estimate}=\\frac{V}{A_{web}}\\). This calculation is much simpler, but it is important to note that it is only an estimate. In most cases the maximum shear stress will be significantly less than the allowable shear stress and this estimate will suffice to demonstrate that. In the rare case that the maximum shear stress is within 20% of the allowable shear stress, an exact value must be determined using \\(\\tau_{\\max }=\\frac{V Q}{I t}\\). The beam was already selected to meet the bending stress and deflection requirements. As long as the maximum shear stress is less than the allowable shear stress, the beam can be used.

Figure 4.7 shows a 3D stress element subjected to the general state of stress – that is, 3 normal stresses (σx, σy, and σz) and 6 shear stresses τxy, τxz, τyx and τyz, τzx and τzy.\nFigure 4.8 shows a stress element for the simplified case of plane stress – that is, stresses acting in a single plane. Under plane stress, the element experiences normal stresses σx and σy, and shear stress τxy = τxz.\nThese stress elements are a convenient way to show the stresses at a particular orientation of the stress element, often in the x-y plane. However, we sometimes want to know the stresses at different orientations. For example, in Section 2.4 we learned how to calculate the stresses on inclined planes. There we were calculating the stresses at specific orientations that were not in the x-y directions, but rather at some angle relative to the x-y directions.\nIn this chapter we will develop a more general approach where we can begin with the stresses in any given direction (usually starting with the x-y directions is simplest) and use these stresses to calculate the stresses at different orientations of the stress element. This process is known as stress transformation.\nIn Section 12.1 we will develop equations that allow us to begin with normal and shear stresses in the x-y directions and transform them to determine the stresses at any other orientation.\nIn Section 12.2 we will expand on these equations in order to determine the maximum and minimum stresses, as well as the orientations that they occur at.\nIn Section 12.3 we will discuss an alternative graphical method for performing stress transformation, known as Mohr’s circle.\nIn Section 12.4 we will use Mohr’s circle to expand our analysis and look at the stresses not only in the original 2D plane, but also at the out-of-plane stresses.",

    "text": "12.1 Stress Transformations\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nThe choice of a coordinate system to use when calculating stresses for a given loading condition is often chosen based on convenience, or what is considered to be the most straight forward system for the given loading directions and the geometrical orientation of the body. For example, consider the simple case of an axial load applied to a rectangular bar as shown in Figure 12.1. It is convenient to use a coordinate system in which one axis aligns with the longitudinal axis of the bar and the other two axis aligned with the edges of the cross-section. With this coordinate system, the general stress state can be quickly determined to consist of only a normal stress in the x direction. We can represent the state of stress at a given point, say point H, on a stress element. Remember that this stress element is actually a 3D object even though we typically draw a 2D plane view of the element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: For simplicity, the x,y,z coordinate axes are cbosen to line up with the direction of loading and the longitudinal axis of the bar\n\n\n\nHowever, the coordinate systems that are the most straightforward to base stress calculations on do not always represent the directions for which the stress levels are the most critical. In the above example, if the bar consists of two sections glued together at an angle, or if the bar is made of wood or composite material with the grains or fibers running at angle to the horizontal, one might be concerned with the level of stress parallel and/or perpendicular to the joint surface (or grains/fibers).\nFigure 12.2 shows an air duct which is part of a heat pump system and is subject to internal air pressure. Pressure vessels will be discussed in Chapter 13 and it will be shown that equations to calculate stress based on pressure and geometrical parameters in the longitudinal and hoop directions can be straightforwardly derived. However, as is the case for the duct in the figure, pressure vessels can often be made with welded seams wound in a helical pattern that forms an angle with the horizontal and vertical axes. It would be important to know the stresses in the directions parallel and perpendicular to these seams to ensure that the joint could tolerate the loading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: A pressurized duct is fabricated with welding in a helical pattern\n\n\n\nNow we’ll use trigonometry to develop a general set of equations to transform stresses from one set of coordinate axes to another. Consider a stress element representing the state of stress at a point in the xy plane as shown in Figure 12.3. If we want to use the known stresses in the xy coordinate system to find the stresses parallel and perpendicular to a different plane, represented by the incline shown on the element, we can cut through the element at the appropriate angle and consider the free body diagram on the cut section. The FBD of the cut element shows the known stresses on the uncut sides of the element and the unknown internal reaction normal and shear stresses, σn and τnt, on the cut side of the element. The internal reactions are represented in the directions for which we want to know the stress state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Stress element cut along plane of interest\n\n\n\nConsider the area of the cut side of the element on which σn and τnt act to be dA’. By applying trigonometry we can say that the area of the side on which σx acts, dAx, is:\n\\[\nd A_x=d A^{\\prime}(\\sin \\beta)=d A^{\\prime} \\cos (\\theta)\n\\]\nand the area of the side on which σy acts is:\n\\[\nd A_x=d A^{\\prime}(\\cos \\beta)=d A^{\\prime} \\sin (\\theta)\n\\]\nWe can apply equilibrium to obtain expressions for σn and τnt if we express the stress components as forces and resolve those forces into the n and t directions. The force corresponding to each direction of stress is obtained by multiplying the stress with the area it acts on (i.e., the force corresponding to σx is σx*dAx).\nFrom σx we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F_n=-\\sigma x^* d A x^* \\cos (\\theta)=-\\sigma x^* d A^{\\prime} \\cos (\\theta) \\cos (\\theta) \\\\\n& \\mathrm{Ft}=\\sigma x^* \\mathrm{~d} A x^* \\sin (\\theta)=\\sigma x^* d A^{\\prime} \\cos (\\theta) \\sin (\\theta)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFrom σy we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F_n=-\\sigma y^* d A y^* \\sin (\\theta)=-\\sigma y^* d A^{\\prime} \\sin (\\theta) \\sin (\\theta) \\\\\n& F t=-\\sigma y^* d A y^* \\cos (\\theta)=-\\sigma y^* d A^{\\prime} \\cos (\\theta) \\sin (\\theta)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFrom the vertical shear stress acting on the x-face we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F n=-\\tau_{xy}{ }^* d A x^* \\sin (\\theta)=-\\tau x y^* d A^{\\prime} \\cos (\\theta) \\sin (\\theta) \\\\\n& F t=-\\tau_{xy}{ }^* d A x^* \\cos (\\theta)=-\\tau x y^* d A^{\\prime} \\cos (\\theta) \\cos (\\theta)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFrom the horizontal shear stress acting on the y face we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathrm{Fn}=-\\tau_{xy} *^* d A x^* \\cos (\\theta)=-\\tau x y^* d^{\\prime} \\sin (\\theta) \\cos (\\theta) \\\\\n& F t=\\tau_{xy}{ }^* d A y^* \\sin (\\theta)=\\tau_{x y}^* d A^{\\prime} \\sin (\\theta) \\sin (\\theta)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nApplying equilibrium in the n and t directions:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\sum F_n=-\\sigma_x * d A^{\\prime} * \\cos ^2(\\theta)-\\sigma_y * d A^{\\prime} * \\sin ^2(\\theta)-2 \\tau_{x y} * d A^{\\prime} * \\cos (\\theta) \\sin (\\theta)=0 \\\\\n\\sum F_t=\\sigma_x * d A^{\\prime} * \\cos (\\theta) \\sin (\\theta)-\\sigma_y * d A^{\\prime} * \\cos (\\theta) \\sin (\\theta)+\\tau_{x y} * d A^{\\prime} *\\left(\\sin ^2(\\theta)-\\cos ^2(\\theta)\\right) \\\\\n+\\tau_{n t} d A^{\\prime}=0\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nSolving the equations for σn and τnt and simplifying terms gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sigma_n=\\sigma_x \\cos ^2(\\theta)+\\sigma_y \\sin ^2(\\theta)+2 \\tau_{x y} \\sin (\\theta) \\cos (\\theta) \\\\\n& \\tau_{n t}=-\\left(\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y\\right) \\cos (\\theta) \\sin (\\theta)+\\tau_{x y}\\left(\\cos ^2(\\theta)-\\sin ^2(\\theta)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThese equations are known as the stress transformation equations.\nAlternatively, implementing the trig identities:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\cos ^2(\\theta)=\\frac{1+\\cos (2 \\theta)}{2} \\\\\n\\sin ^2(\\theta)=\\frac{1-\\cos (2 \\theta)}{2} \\\\\n\\sin (2 \\theta)=2 \\sin (\\theta) \\cos (\\theta) \\\\\n\\cos (2 \\theta)=\\cos ^2(\\theta)-\\sin ^2(\\theta)\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nThe transformation equations can also be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma_n & =\\frac{\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y}{2}+\\frac{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y}{2} \\cos (2 \\theta)+\\tau_{x y} \\sin (2 \\theta) \\\\\n\\tau_{n t} & =-\\frac{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y}{2} \\sin (2 \\theta)+\\tau_{x y} \\cos (2 \\theta)\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\tag{12.1}\\]\nwhere\n𝜎n = Average normal stress perpendicular to the inclined plane [Pa, psi]\n𝜏nt = Average shear stress parallel to the inclined plane [Pa, psi]\n𝜎x = Average normal stress in the x-direction, prior to any transformation [Pa, psi]\n𝜎y = Average normal stress in the y-direction, prior to any transformation [Pa, psi]\n𝜏xy = Average shear stress in the xy plane, prior to any transformation [Pa, psi]\n𝜃 = Angle between x-axis and transformed stress being caculated [\\(^\\circ\\), rad]\nEither set of transformation equations will work. The choice over which set to use is based on personal preference.\nThe stress transformation equations can be used to take a set of stresses calculated in the chosen coordinate system (xy) and transform them to a different coordinate system (x’y’), as shown in Figure 12.4. With θ defined to be the angle between the x-axis and the normal to the plane of interest as shown in Figure 12.3, the σn equation gives the stress on the rotated x-face, which we will call the σx’. To find σy’, the normal stress on the rotated y-face, we can simply sub an angle of (90° + θ) into the σn equation since the y’ axis would be rotated an additional 90° form the x-axis. Also note that substituting θ into the τnt equation gives τx’y’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: The angle θ is defined to be the angle between the original x axis and the normal to the plane of interest. Subbing θ into the stress transformation equations gives σx’ and τx’y whle subbing in ( 90° + θ) gives σy’.\n\n\n\nAnother way to quickly determine the normal stress along the y’ axis once σx’ is known is to make use of the concept of stress invariance which is the idea that sum of the normal stresses (σx + σy) remains constant regardless of the plane in which they are calculated. Put another way, the stress invariance principle allows us to say that (σx + σy) = (σx’ + σy’).\nThe angle of incline may be measured and given relative to a variety of reference axes. It is imperative that one understands which angle to substitute into the transformation equations given above. To ensure you have the correct angle, take the following steps and see Figure 12.5:\n\nDraw a line that represents the plane of interest\nDraw the x-axis positive going towards the right\nDraw the axis normal to the plane of interest. It does not matter if you draw the normal axis as oriented counterclockwise or clockwise from the x-axis as long as you use the correct sign for the angle (see step 4).\nDetermine the angle that goes from the x-axis to the normal axis. This angle is θ. If the direction from the x-axis to the normal axis is counterclockwise, then θ should be taken to be positive. If the direction from the x-axis to the normal axis is clockwise, then θ should be taken to be negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Draw a sketch of the x-axis and the normal axis to ensure you use the correct magnitude and sign for θ in the stress transformation equations.\n\n\n\nFinally, one should note that the transformation equations were derived based on stresses given in the the x-y plane where x is the horizontal axis positive to the right and y is the vertical axis positive upwards. If a plane other than the xy plane is being used for the general stress calculations, or if the x and y axes are oriented in the opposite configuration, the rule to follow would be to substitute the stress normal to the vertical faces of the element in for the σx terms of the equations and the stress normal to the horizontal faces of the element in the σy terms of the equations. For example, given the stress element in Figure 12.6, one would substitute σz = 90 MPa in for the σx terms of the stress transformation equations, σx = -150 MPa in for the σy terms, and τxz = -16 MPa in for the τxy terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: Element drawn in the xz plane\n\n\n\nExample 12.1 and Example 12.2 below illustrate the use of the stress of transformation equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12.1  \n\n\nThe general stress state at a point on a hollow pipe formed with spiral welds inclined to an angle β with respect to the horizontal is shown below. For stress magnitudes given as follows: Sx = 128 MPa, Sy = 80 MPa, Sxy = 75.45 MPa, and β = 42°. Determine the stress parallel and perpendicular to weld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stress parallel and perpendicular to the weld can be found by applying the stress transformation equations with σx = 128 MPa, σy = 80 MPa, and τxy = -75.45 MPa:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sigma_n=\\sigma_x \\cos ^2(\\theta)+\\sigma_y \\sin ^2(\\theta)+2 \\tau_{x y} \\sin (\\theta) \\cos (\\theta) \\\\\n& \\tau_{n t}=-\\left(\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y\\right) \\cos (\\theta) \\sin (\\theta)+\\tau_{x y}\\left(\\cos ^2(\\theta)-\\sin ^2(\\theta)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNotice that the normal stresses are positive since they are both shown to be tensile on the given stress element but the shear stress is negative based on the fact that the shear stress arrow goes in the negative y direction on the positive x-face (the same conclusion can be drawn by observing any of the other faces).\nBefore performing the calculation, the appropriate angle θ must also be found. The plane of interest in this as is the plane of the weld which is represented by the line representing the spiral. The angle θ needed to substitute into the equations is the angle between the x-axis and th normal axis to the weld. Based on the normal axis below the x-axis, we can see θ is θ = -(90 – β) = -48°. The angle is negative since it is a clockwise rotation to get from the x axis to the n-axis below.\nWe could also base θ on the dashed normal axis, in which case the magnitude of θ would be θ = 180° – 48° = 132°. This angle is positive since the rotation from the x-axis to the dashed normal axis is counterclockwise.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo with σx = 128 MPa, σy = 80 MPa, τxy = -75.45 MPa, and θ = -48° (or +132°), the stress normal to the weld is σn = 139.0 MPa. The stress parallel to the weld is τnt = 31.76 MPa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12.2  \n\n\nThe stresses shown act at a point in a stressed body as shown. Normal and shear stress magnitudes acting on horizontal and vertical planes at the point are Sx = 1700 psi, Sy = 800 psi, and Sxy = 790 psi. Determine the normal (positive if tensile, negative if compressive) and shear stresses at this point on the inclined plane shown. Assume β = 36°.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will first determine the angle θ that we need for the stress transformation equations. Recall the the process described in Section 12.1:\n\nDraw a line that represents the plane of interest\nDraw the x-axis positive going towards the right\nDraw the axis normal to the plane of interest. It does not matter if you draw the normal axis as oriented counterclockwise or clockwise from the x-axis as long as you use the correct sign for the angle (see step 4).\nDetermine the angle that goes from the x-axis to the normal axis. This angle is θ. If the direction from the x-axis to the normal axis is counterclockwise, then θ should be taken to be positive. If the direction from the x-axis to the normal axis is clockwise, then θ should be taken to be negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEither angle labeled θ in the illustration will work and produce the same results. In this example, we will use the smaller of the two:\nθ = 90 – β = 54°.\nThe angle is positive since the n-axis is rotated counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\nWith θ determined, the only thing left to do is make the subsitutions into the stress transformation equations and calculate. Note that the σn equation will give us the normal stress on the rotated x-face (x’), so will need to also calculate σn with the angle (θ + 90°) to get σy’ or use the stress invariance concept: (σx + σy = σx’ + σy’)\nSubstituting σx = -1700 psi (negative since it is shown to be compressive), σy = 800 psi, τxy = 790 psi, and θ = 54° into:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sigma_n=\\frac{\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y}{2}+\\frac{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y}{2} \\cos (2 \\theta)+\\tau_{x y} \\sin (2 \\theta) \\\\\n& \\tau_{n t}=-\\frac{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y}{2} \\sin (2 \\theta)+\\tau_{x y} \\cos (2 \\theta)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nGives σx’ = 687.6 psi and τx’y’ = 945 psi.\nFurthermore, applying stress invariance: -1700 psi + 800 psi = 687.6 psi + σy’ gives σy’ = -1588 psi\nσx’ = 687.6 psi\nτx’y’ = 945 psi\nσy’ = -1588 psi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Stress transformation\n\n\n\nGiven a general stress state (σx, σy, and τxy) at a point in the x-y plane where x is the horizontal axis positive to the right and y is the vertical axis positive upwards:\n\nEstablish the angle θ that corresponds to the angle of rotation between the positive x-axis and the axis normal (x’) to the plane of interest. Remember to make the angle negative if the rotation is clockwise from the x axis to the normal axis and positive if the rotation is counterclockwise.\nSubstitute in the stresses with appropriate sign and the angle θ with appropriate sign into the stress transformation equations to find σn and τnt. Remember that normal stresses are negative if compressive and positive if tensile, shear stresses are positive if the shear stress arrow on the positive x face points in the positive y direction and negative otherwise. This will give σx’ and τx’y’.\nUse (θ+90°) in the σn transformation equation or the concept of stress invariance (σx + σy = σx’ + σy’) to find σy’.",

    "text": "12.2 Principal Stresses and Max/Min Shear Stress\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nOften, the plane we would be the most concerned with is the one on which the normal stress or the shear stress is at a maximum or minimum. The maximum and minimum normal stresses are referred to as the principal stresses (σ1 and σ2) and the planes on which they act (described by angle of rotation of the stress element, θp1 and θp2) are the principal planes. The maximum and minimum shear stresses are simply referred to as the maximum and minimum shear stress, respectively, and the planes on which they occur are referred to simply as the planes of maximum and minimum shear stress (denoted as θs1 and θs2).\nIt is important to note that in this section, only rotations within a two dimensional plane are being considered. As will be seen in Section 12.4, the principal planes and principal stresses are the same even when considering out of plane rotation of the stress element (see Figure 12.7), but the max shear stress could be different. Therefore, the max and min sheer stress as determined by the below derived equations will be referred to as the max/min in-plane shear stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.7: The max shear stress obtained from in-plane rotations of the stress element may not be the same as the max shear stress when considering out of plane rotation as well. This section describes how to find the max/min in-plane shear stress.\n\n\n\nAs we rotate the stress element and the angle θ changes, the stress changes in a predictable way. Figure 12.8 shows the variation of normal stress σx’ with angle θ. The principal stresses can be seen to occur at specific values of θ. These angles will be 90° apart from one another. A similar graph could be drawn for τx’y’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.8: Plot showing how normal stress σx’ varies with angle θ.\n\n\n\nSince these stresses are maximums and minimums (i.e., the slope of the curve is zero at these points) and since the transformation equations derived in Section 12.1 are functions in terms of the plane rotation angle θ, we can simply take the derivates of the two equations and set them equal to zero to find the angles at which we would get the maximum and minimum of each type of stress. Using the second set of transformation equations derived in Section 12.1 (though the first set would yield the same results):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{d \\sigma_n}{d \\theta}=-\\left(\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y\\right) \\sin \\left(2 \\theta_p\\right)+2 \\tau_{x y} \\cos \\left(2 \\theta_p\\right)=0 \\\\\n& \\frac{d \\tau_{n t}}{d \\theta}=-\\left(\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y\\right) \\cos \\left(2 \\theta_s\\right)-2 \\tau_{x y} \\sin \\left(2 \\theta_s\\right)=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNotice that θ is subscripted with a p in the first equation since this theta represents a principal plane as defined above. Similarly, θ is subscripted with and S in the second equation since this theta represents a plane of max or min in-plane shear stress.\nThese equations can be rearranged to isolate Tan (2θ) on one side and subsequently used to find θp and θs values:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{aligned}\n\\tan \\left(2 \\theta_p\\right) & =\\frac{2 \\tau_{x y}}{\\left(\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y\\right)} \\\\\n\\tan \\left(2 \\theta_s\\right) & =-\\frac{\\left(\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y\\right)}{2 \\tau_{x y}}\n\\end{aligned}}\n\\tag{12.2}\\]\nwhere\n𝜃p = Orientation of one of the principal planes, with respect to the x-axis [\\(^\\circ\\), rad]\n𝜃s = Orientation of one of the maximum shear planes, with respect to the x-axis [\\(^\\circ\\), rad]\n𝜏xy = Average shear stress in the xy plane, prior to any transformation [Pa, psi]\n𝜎x = Average normal stress in the x-direction, prior to any transformation [Pa, psi]\n𝜎y = Average normal stress in the y-direction, prior to any transformation [Pa, psi]\nOnce the angles associated with the planes of extreme stresses are determined, they can be substituted into the stress transformation equation of Section 12.1 along with the stresses in the given plane to find the principal stresses and max/min shear stress.\nA few calculation details that it will be helpful to remember are:\n\nThe inverse tangent function has two possible solutions. One solution would be the angle that will be reported by a calculator, and the other possible answer is the angle that is that angle plus or minus 180°. So if you use your calculator to solve the Tan (2θp) equation, you would take half that to get the first principle angle and then add or subtract 90 degrees to that principal angle to get the second. The same idea applies to finding the two θs angles.\nBy convention, the most positive of the two principal stresses is denoted as σ1. The other principal stress is then σ2. The angle that produces that σ1 stress is θp1 and the angle that produces σ2 is θp2.\nThe max and min in-plane shear stresses will always turn out to be equal in magnitude by opposite in sign, or in other words, the minimum shear stress is always the negative of the maximum shear stress. As with the principal planes and stresses, one would need to substitute one of the θs angles into the shear stress transformation equation to determine which angle corresponds to the maximum in-plane shear stress and which corresponds to the minimum.\nThe angles of maximum and minimum shear stresses are 90° apart from each other, and 45° apart from the principal directions. If one principal direction is found to be, for example, 40° then the other principal direction can be determined as either (40° + 90° =) 130° or (40° - 90° =) -50°. The angles of maximum and minimum in-plane shear stress can then be determined as either (40° + 45° =) 95° or (40° - 45° =) - 5°. It is also acceptable to add or subtract 45° from 130° or from – 50°.\nGiven the variety of different of possible correct angles, we will use a convention that principal directions and angles of maximum and minimum shear stress will be calculated in the range – 90° ≤ θ ≤ + 90°.\n\nIf desired, the principal stresses and max./min. shear stresses can be calculated directly without first finding the principal directions:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{gathered}\n\\sigma_{1,2}=\\frac{\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2+\\tau_{x y}{ }^2} \\\\\n\\tau_{x \\prime y^{\\prime}}= \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2+\\tau_{x y}{ }^2}\n\\end{gathered}}\n\\tag{12.3}\\]\nwhere\n𝜎1,2 = Principal stresses [Pa, psi]\n𝜎x = Average normal stress in the x-direction, prior to any transformation [Pa, psi]\n𝜎y = Average normal stress in the y-direction, prior to any transformation [Pa, psi]\n𝜏xy = Average shear stress in the xy plane, prior to any transformation [Pa, psi]\nSome useful conclusions that can be drawn simply by studying the principal plane and plane of max/min shear stress equations are as follows:\n\nIf the shear stress transformation equation given in Section 12.1 is set equal to 0 in order to find the plane at which shear stress is equal to 0, we would arrive at the same equation as the Tan(2θp) found above. We can then conclude that shear stress is 0 on the principal planes. It can also be said that if the shear stress is found to be 0 on any given plane, then that plane must be a principal plane.\nThe equation for Tan(2θs) is the negative inverse of the equation for Tan (2θp). This means that 2θs = 2θp ± 90° or θs = θp ± 45°. Recognizing this can allow one to calculate one set of angles more efficiently once the other is found.\nIf either of the θs angles are substituted into the normal stress transformation equation, the normal stress would work out to be the average stress \\(\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y}{2}\\right)\\). Once again, this recognition can help make determining the total stress state on the plane of max/min shear stress more efficient.\n\nExample 12.3 demonstrates the calculation of the principal stresses, the maximum in-plane shear stress, and the orientations that these stresses occur at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12.3  \n\n\nThe state of plane stress at a point is represented by the stress element below. Determine the principal stresses and the maximum in-plane shear stress and draw the corresponding stress elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the steps given at the end of Section 12.2:\n\nFind the principal planes using\n\\[\n\\operatorname{Tan}\\left(2 \\theta_p\\right)=\\frac{2 \\tau_{x y}}{\\left(\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y\\right)}\n\\]\n\nWith σx = -80 MPa, σy = 50 MPa, and τxy = -25 MPa, we get:\nθp = 10.52° based on the answer from the calculator.\nThe other angle is then θp = 10.52° + 90° = 100.52°\nSo the principal plane angles are 10.52° and 100.52°.\nSubbing θp = 10.52° into:\n\\[\n\\sigma_n=\\frac{\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y}{2}+\\frac{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y}{2} \\cos (2 \\theta)+\\tau_{x y} \\sin (2 \\theta)\n\\]\ngives σn = -84.6 MPa and subbing θp = 100.52° in gives σn = 54.6 MPa.\nSince 54.6 MPa is the most positive of the two principal stresses, σ1 = 54.6 MPa and σ2 = -84.6 MPa.\nThe 54.6 MPa would go on the rotated x-face and the -85.6 MPa would go on the rotated y-face of the stress element rotated counterclockwise 100.52°.\n\nConversely, if the stress element is rotated counterclockwise by 10.52°, the stress on the rotated x-face would be -84.6 MPa and the stress on the rotated y-face would be 54.6 MPa.\nDrawing the stress element rotated to the principal planes:\n\n\nNotice that the stress element looks the same no matter which angle is used for the rotation. Also note that the shear stress on the principal plane is 0.\nNext we will find the planes of max/min in-plane shear planes as well as the corresponding shear stresses. We could use:\n\\[\n\\operatorname{Tan}\\left(2 \\theta_s\\right)=-\\frac{\\left(\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y\\right)}{2 \\tau_{x y}}\n\\]\nBut since we already have the θp angles, we will use the fact that the max/min in-plane shear stress planes are +/- 45° from those. We can choose either θp angle to add and subtract the 45° to and from. The final orientation of the element would be the same. Since it is generally easier to visualize angle rotations smaller in magnitude than 90, so we will use the smaller θp value.\nSo θs = 10.52° +/- 45° = 55.5° and -34.5°.\nSubbing θs = 55.5° into:\n\\[\n\\tau_{n t}=-\\frac{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y}{2} \\sin (2 \\theta)+\\tau_{x y} \\cos (2 \\theta)\n\\]\ngives τnt = 69.6 MPa. Since this is a positive value, we know that this is the max in-plane shear stress and that θs = -34.5 ° should give τnt = -69.6 MPa = τmin (in-plane).\nSo if we rotate the stress element counterclockwise by 55.5°, we would draw a positive shear stress and if we rotate it clockwise 34.5 degrees, we would draw a negative shear stress.\nThe normal stress on the plane of max/min in-plane shear stress is\n\\[\n\\sigma=\\sigma_{avg}=\\frac{\\left(\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y\\right)}{2}=-15 \\mathrm{MPa}\n\\]\n\nDrawing the stress rotated to the planes of max/min shear stress:\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, notice that the stress element looks fundamentally the same regardless of which θs angle is used.\nθp1 = 100.52° and θp2 = 10.52°\nσ1 = 54.6 MPa and σ2 = - 84.6 MPa\nθs = 55.5° and -34.5°\nτmax (in-plane) = 69.6 MPa\nτmin (in-plane) = - 69.6 MPa\nElements are drawn above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Principal Stresses and max/min shear stress\n\n\n\nGiven a general stress state (σx, σy, and τxy) at a point in the x-y plane where x is the horizontal axis positive to the right and y is the vertical axis positive upwards:\n\nUse the Tan(2θp) equation to find the planes of principal stresses. The angle reported by the calculator provides twice one of the angles. The other is determined by adding or subtracting 90° from the first.\nSubstitute the two θp angles into the σn transformation equation to determine the principal stresses. The most positive of the two is deemed σ1 and the other is σ2. Alternatively, only sub one of the angles into the stress transformation to get one of the principal stresses. The other principal stress can be calculated using stress invariance.\nUse the Tan(2θs) equation to find the planes of max/min in-plane shear stress. Alternatively, add/subtract 45° to one of the principal plane angles.\nSubstitute one of the θs angles into the τnt equation to determine whether it leads to the max in-plane shear stress or the min. The other angle will lead to a shear stress of equal magnitude but opposite sign.\nCalculate the average stress. This stress is the normal stress on the x’ and y’ faces when the element is rotated to the planes of max/min in-plane shear stress.",

    "section": "12.3 Mohr’s Circle",
    "text": "12.3 Mohr’s Circle\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nAs an alternative to using equations to determine principal planes and stresses as well as max/min shear planes and stresses, one can use a graphical method known as Mohr’s Circle. The stress transformation equations can be seen to actually be equations of a circle where the perimeter of the circle consists of coordinates points that correspond to normal stress on the horizontal axis and shear stress on the vertical axis. The advantage of using Mohr’s Circle is that it does not involve needing to recall equations and can be quick and efficient to use with some practice.\nTo construct the circle (refer to the fully constructed Mohr’s circle in Figure 12.11):\n\nTo start, draw a set of coordinate axes where normal stress will be on the horizontal axis and shear stress will be on horizontal axis. Note in 12.9 that the shear stress is labeled with a (CW) for clockwise on the positive side and a (CCW) for counterclockwise on the negative side as a reminder of how the signs on the vertical coordinates are determined.\nPlot the center of the circle, C, which will lie on the normal stress axis at a point equal to the average normal stress.\n\\[\nC=\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y}{2}, 0\\right)\n\\]\nNext, one coordinate point on the circle needs to be established based on the given stress state and plotted on the axes. This point, which we will call the x-point, will come from the stresses drawn on the positive x-face of the stress element. The normal stress is positive if tensile and negative if compressive. The sign on the vertical coordinate, the shear stress, will depend on the direction of rotation that the shear stress on the x-face will cause. If it would tend to rotate the element clockwise, it will be plotted on the positive side of the vertical axis and vice versa.\nOn the representative stress element in Figure 12.9 below, the normal stress on the x face is tensile and the upwards shear stress would tend to cause the element rotate counterclockwise, so the x-point is (+σx, -τxy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.9: Positive x-face of a stress element showing the normal and shear stresses used to plot the coordinate point on Mohr’s circle. On this face, the normal stress is positive and the shear stress causes the element to rotate counterclockwise.\n\n\n\nWe could alternatively use what we will call the y-point, which comes from the stresses acting on the positive y-face of the stress element with the same sign conventions above. For the representative stress element of Figure 12.9, the normal stress on the y face (Figure 12.10) is drawn in the tensile direction and the rightwards shear stress would tend to cause the element to rotate clockwise, so the y-point is (+σy, +τxy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.10: The positive y-face of a stress element showing the normal and shear stresses used to plot the coordinate point on Mohr’s circle. On this face, the normal stress is positive and the shear stress causes the element to rotate clockwise.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the center and either the x-point or y-point are plotted, draw a line that connects them. This line is the radius of the circle. This radius, R, can be determined using of the Pythagorean Theorem on the triangle formed between C, σx, and the x-point. Since the radius of the circle will be constant, we can now draw the rest of the circle.\n\\[\nR=\\sqrt{\\left(\\sigma_x-C\\right)^2+\\tau_{x y}^2}\n\\]\nRecalling that the shear stress is zero on the principal plane, we can observe that that corresponds exactly to the normal stress axis so we can identify σ1 to be the normal stress on the right extreme of the circle and σ2 to be the normal stress on the left extreme of the circle. Furthermore, based on inspection of the circle and the known points, we can see that σ1 = C + R and σ2 = C - R.\nIt can also be seen that the max and min in-plane shear stress would be at the bottom and top of the circle, respectively, so we can say that τmax = +R and τmin = -R.\nThe max shear stress is at the bottom since a positive shear stress on the positive x-face would cause the stress element to rotate counterclockwise.\nThe circle also confirms that the normal stress on the plane of max/min in-plane shear stress is \\(\\mathrm{C}=\\sigma_{avg}=\\frac{\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y}{2}\\)\nTo find the angles of the principal planes and max/min shear stress, or to use the circle to perform stress transformations to arbitrary planes, one must note that rotations around the circle represent twice the actual amount of rotation required to get from the stress state in one plane to the stress state in the rotated plane. Furthermore, rotations counterclockwise from the x-point are considered to be positive angles and the rotations clockwise from the x-point are considered to be negative angles.\nThus, the angle between the radial line that connects C and the x-point to the principal plane (normal stress axis) is 2θp. This angle can be determined by applying right triangle trigonometry principles to the right triangle used to find the radius:\n\\[\n\\tan (2 \\theta p)=\\frac{C+\\sigma_x}{\\tau_{x y}}\n\\]\nAs discussed in Section 12.2, the inverse tangent function will have two solutions. One of those solutions (divided by 2) will be the angle that corresponds to rotating from the x point to the σ1 side of the circle from which means that this principal angle leads to σ1 acting on the rotated x face (x’ face) of the stress element and therefore σ2 acts on the rotated y face (y’ face). The other solution to θp will correspond to the angle necessary to rotate from the x point to the σ2 side of the circle which will lead to σ2 acting on the x’ face and σ1 acting on the y’ face.\nThe angle to the plane of max/min in-plane shear stress can be found in a similar manner. By visual inspection one can see that the tan(2θs) will be the inverse of tan(2θp). Alternatively, it can be calculated as 2θs = 90° - 2θp. One should note, however, the directions of the angles for rotation.  Recalling the convention used to apply sign to the shear stress coordinate, the angle that goes from the x-point to the negative side of the shear stress axis will correspond to the rotation that results in the maximum in-plane shear stress and vice versa.\nOnce these quantities are known, the use of the circle to perform stress transformations at arbitrary planes requires making similar trigonometric calculations. This process is better illustrated in Example 12.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Mohr’s circle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Stress Element\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.11: Fully constructed Mohr’s circle for the representative stress element shown",

    "section": "12.4 Mohr’s Circle in 3-Dimensions and Absolute Max Shear Stress",
    "text": "12.4 Mohr’s Circle in 3-Dimensions and Absolute Max Shear Stress\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nThe methods discussed so far in Sections 12.2 and 12.3 provide the maximum in-plane shear stress that arises from planar rotations in the 2D plane, but as discussed in Section 12.2, the actual maximum shear stress may result from an out of plane rotation. Thus, while this text is generally restricted to planar (2D) stress states, we need to consider a 3D stress element in order to determine the absolute maximum shear stress.\nHowever, we are still considering only cases in which the stresses act in just two of the three principal directions. For the sake of this discussion, we will say that the stresses act in only the x and y directions, though it could generally be any combination of two axes. If stresses act only in the x and y directions, then a 3D stress element would include these stresses on the x and y faces, but the normal stress on the z face would be zero and the shear stress in the xz and yz planes would also be zero (see Figure 12.12). Recalling the earlier finding that if the shear stress is 0 on a given plane, the plane is a principal plane, we can say that the xz plane and the yz planes are principal planes with respect to rotation of the element around the y and x axes respectively.\nIt we start with the stress element already rotated in the xy plane to one of its principal planes, we know that the stresses on the x and y faces in this plane (x’ and y’ faces) will be σ1 and σ2 or vice versa. This means that σ1 (or σ2) and σz are the principal stresses on the yz plane and the σ1 (or σ2) and σz are the principal stresses on the xz plane. Since we are still dealing with plane stress, we know that σz = 0. In the case of plane stress then, there are principal stresses σ1 and σ2 as above, as well as σ3 = 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.12: 3D stress element with stress acting in only 2 or the 3 principal directions.\n\n\n\nWe can draw Mohr’s circle for each of these three planes on one plot. We will consider three cases:\n\nσ1 and σ2 on based on the xy plane are both positive\nσ1 and σ2 on based on the xy plane are both negative\nσ1 and σ2 on based on the xy plane are opposite signs\n\nCase 1:\nReferring to Figure 12.13, the larger inner circle is Mohr’s circle for the x-y plane as can be noted by the fact that the max and min normal stresses on that circle are σ1 and σ2, respectively. The smaller inner circle is Mohr’s circle for either the x-z or the y-z plane (whichever one has σ2 as the principal stress on the non-z face). The largest circle is Mohr’s circle for the other of the two non xy planes. We can see in this case that the largest shear stress is given by the radius of the largest circle which is σ1/2.\nSo in the case that σ1 and σ2 are both positive, the absolute max shear stress is:\n\\[\n\\tau_{(\\max )absolute}=\\left|\\frac{\\sigma_1}{2}\\right|\n\\]\nThe absolute value is there since we now the max shear stress must be a positive shear stress given that the max and min shear stresses are negatives of each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.13: The three planes represented on Mohr’s circle for the case where both the principal stresses in the xy plane are positive.\n\n\n\nCase 2:\nReferring to Figure 12.14, all the statements made in Case 1 still hold true except that the radius of the largest circle is now σ2/2.\nSo in the case that σ1 and σ2 are both positive, the absolute max shear stress is:\n\\[\n\\tau_{(\\max )absolute}=\\left|\\frac{\\sigma_2}{2}\\right|\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.14: The three planes represented on Mohr’s circle for the case where both the principal stresses in the xy plane are negative.\n\n\n\nCase 3:\nReferring to Figure 12.15, this case is different than the other two because in this case, the Mohr’s circle for the xy plane is the largest circle. This means that the absolute max shear stress and the maximum in-plane shear stress are the same.\nSo in the case that σ1 and σ2 are opposite in sign, the absolute max shear stress is:\n\\[\n\\tau_{(\\max )absolute}=\\left|\\frac{\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2}{2}\\right|\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.15: The three planes represented on Mohr’s circle for the case where the principal stresses in the xy plane are opposite signs.\n\n\n\nMore generally, given principal stresses σ1, σ2, and σ3 = 0, the abosulte maximum shear stress can be determined from:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\tau_{(\\max)absolute}=\\left|\\frac{\\sigma_{\\max }-\\sigma_{\\min }}{2}\\right|}\n\\tag{12.4}\\]\nwhere\n𝜏(max)absolute = Absolute maximum shear stress [Pa, psi]\n𝜎max = Maximum principal stress [Pa, psi]\n𝜎min = Minimum principal stress [Pa, psi]\nThis works for any of the cases above:\n\nCase 1: σmax = σ1, σmin = 0\nCase 2: σmax = 0, σmin = σ2\nCase 3: σmax = σ1, σmin = σ2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12.4  \n\n\nFor the stress state given by the stress element below, use Mohr’s Circle to find:\n\nThe principal planes and principal stresses. Sketch the stress element rotated to these planes.\nThe max in-plane shear stress and the plane at which it acts. Sketch the stress element rotated to this plane.\nThe stress state on the plane on which the stress element is rotated clockwise 40°. Sketch the stress element rotated to this plane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12.4 demonstrates the use of Mohr’s circle for a stress transformation problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the steps given in Section 12.3:\n\nThe step of drawing the axes will be done as a part of step 3.\nIdentify and plot the x-point: Looking at the positive x-face, the normal stress is compressive, so the horizontal coordinate will be -60 MPa. The shear stress arrow is upwards, which would tend to rotate the element counterclockwise, so the vertical coordinate will be negative, or -30 MPa. The x-point is then (-60,-30) MPa\n\nIdentify and plot the y-point: Looking at the positive y-face, the normal stress is tensile, so the horizontal coordinate will be +15 MPa. The shear stress arrow is to the right, which would tend to rotate the element clockwise, so the vertical coordinate will be positive, or +30 MPa. The y-point is then (15,30) MPa.\n\nThe points are shown plotted in step 3.\nConnect the two points on the circle and identify the center.\n\\[\nC=\\frac{\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y}{2}=\\frac{-60+15}{2}=-22.5 \\mathrm{MPa}\n\\]\n\nThe radius of the circle is: \\(R=\\sqrt{\\left(\\sigma_x-C\\right)^2+\\tau_{x y}^2}=\\sqrt{(-60-(-22.5))^2+30^2}=48.02 \\mathrm{MPa}\\)\nWe can now find σ1 by finding the distance from the origin to the rightmost point of the circle on the σ axis. Since C is negative, we can find distance to be C + R = -22.5 MPa + 48.02 MPa = 25.52 MPa.\nSo σ1 = 25.5 MPa\nWe can find σ2 by finding the distance from the origin to the leftmost point of the circle on the σ axis. This distance can be expressed as C- R  = -48.02 MPa – 22.5 MPa = -70.52 MPa\nSo σ2 = -70.5 MPa\nThe max in-plane shear stress is the bottom most point of the circle which is simply R = 48.02 MPa, or τmax (in-plane) = 48.0 MPa.\nThe normal stress on this plane is C = -22.5 MPa\nThe principal planes can be found as: \\(tan(2\\theta_p)=\\frac{\\sigma_x-C}{\\tau_{xy}}=\\frac{-60{~MPa}-(-22.5{~MPa})}{30{~MPa}}\\)\nOne solution to this equation yields θp = -25.67°. This is the angle of rotation for which σ2 would be shown on the rotated x face. Note the negative angle means this would be a clockwise rotation.\nThe other solution to the equation is that angle plus 90°, which in this case yields θp = 64.33°. This is the angle of rotation for which σ1 would appear on the rotated x-face. The positive angle indicates this would be a counterclockwise rotation.\n\nWith the θp angles known, we can see that the 2θs = 90 - 2θp, or θs = 19.33° and -70.67°. In this case, a counterclockwise rotation of the x-point would bring it to the negative side of the vertical axis which corresponds to τmax, so we can say that θs = 19.33° is the plane of max in-plane shear stress.\n\nNow we can use Mohr’s Circle to find the stress state on the plane where the stress element is rotated clockwise 40°. The circle is redrawn below for convenience.\nRecalling that rotations around the circle are twice the actual rotation, we will draw in a point (denoted as x’) that represents an 80 degree rotation clockwise from the x-point. Since we know from step 7 that the x-point is rotated 2* 25.7° below σ2, we also know that x’ is rotated 80 – 50.4 = 29.6° above σ2.\n\nSince x’ is on the negative σ side and the positive τ side, we know that the normal stress on the x’ face is compressive and the shear stress arrow on the x’ face would tend to rotate the element clockwise (which corresponds to a negative shear stress).\nWe can see from the circle that the shear stress is:\n\\[\n\\tau_{x'y'}=-Rsin(29.6^\\circ)=-48.08{~MPa}*sin(29.6^\\circ)=-23.7{~MPa}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\sigma_{x'}=C-Rcos(29.6^\\circ)=-22.5{~MPa}-48.02{~MPa}*cos(29.6^\\circ)=-64.3{~MPa}\n\\]\nThe stress on the rotated y face, σy’, is obtained by finding the distance from the origin to the y’ point which is directly across the circle from x’.\n\\[\n\\sigma_{y'}=C+Rcos(29.6^\\circ)=-22.5{~MPa}+48.02{~MPa}*cos(29.6^\\circ)=19.3{~MPa}\n\\]\nThe rotated stress element can be drawn:\n\n\nσ1 = 25.5 MPa on the principal plane θp = 64.3°\nσ2 = -70.5 MPa on the principal plane θp = -25.7°\nτmax (in-plane) = 48.0 MPa on the plane θs = 19.33°\nOn the plane rotated 40° clockwise from the given plane:\nσx’ = - 64.3 MPa\nσy’ = 19.3 MPa\nτx’y’ = -23.7 MPa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Determine Absolute Max Shear Stress\n\n\n\nTo determine the absolute max shear stress, it is not necessary to draw out all three circles as was done above for illustrative purposes. One can simply:\n\nDetermine the principal stresses in the xy plane (or whichever 2D plane is being used for the general stress state).\nDetermine the absolute max shear stress to be \\(\\tau_{(max)absolute}=\\left|\\frac{\\sigma_{\\max }-\\sigma_{\\min }}{2}\\right|\\)",

    "text": "13.1 Cylindrical Pressure Vessels\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nThe equations stresses in the wall of a cylindrical pressure vessel can be derived with the help of a free body diagram. Let’s cut a cross-section through our vessel to expose the fluid inside (Figure 13.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: Cross-section through the cylindrical vessel showing the axial stress in the walls (𝜎𝐴) and the fluid pressure P.\n\n\n\nThere will be an axial stress from the internal fluid pressure (P) and an axial stress in the walls of the vessel (𝜎𝐴). Since \\(\\text{stress}=\\frac{\\text { force }}{\\text { area }}\\) we can determine the two forces. The fluid pressure acts over a circular area \\(A=\\pi r_i^2\\). The stress in the walls acts over an area equal to the circumference of the vessel multiplied by the wall thickness, \\(A=2 \\pi r_i t\\).\nBy equilibrium:\n\\[\n\\sum F_x=\\left(\\sigma_A\\right)\\left(2 \\pi r_i t\\right)-(P)\\left(\\pi r_i^2\\right)=0 \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma_A=\\frac{P r_i}{2 t}}\n\\tag{13.1}\\]\nwhere\n𝜎𝐴 = Axial stress in the wall of the vessel [Pa, psi]\nP = Fluid pressure inside the vessel [Pa, psi]\nri = Inner radius of the vessel [m, in.]\nt = Wall thickness of the vessel [m, in.]\nSimilarly there will be a stress in the lateral direction, referred to as the hoop stress 𝜎H. Let’s cut a vertical cross-section (Figure 13.4) to derive an equation for this stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: Cross-section through the cylindrical vessel showing the hoop stress in the walls (𝜎H) and the fluid pressure P.\n\n\n\nThere will again be a stress from the internal fluid pressure (P) and a stress in the walls of the vessel (𝜎H). The fluid pressure acts over an area of \\(A=2 r_i L\\). The stress in the walls acts over an area of \\(A=2 t L\\).\nBy equilibrium:\n\\[\n\\sum F_x=\\left(\\sigma_H\\right)(2 t L)-(P)\\left(2 r_i L\\right)=0 \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma_H=\\frac{P r_i}{t}}\n\\tag{13.2}\\]\nwhere\n𝜎H = Hoop stress in the wall of the vessel [Pa, psi]\nP = Fluid pressure inside the vessel [Pa, psi]\nri = Inner radius of the vessel [m, in.]\nt = Wall thickness of the vessel [m, in.]\nThe internal pressure P is typically reported as the gage pressure, which is defined as the internal pressure minus the atmospheric pressure. This allows us to calculate the stresses directly without needing to account for atmospheric pressure.\nSince the radial stress is assumed to be zero, the axial and hoop stresses represent a state of plane stress such as those discussed in Chapter 12. Further, since there is no shear stress, the axial and hoop stresses represent the principal stresses. Since the hoop stress is larger, this is the first principal stress (𝜎1). The axial stress is the second principal stress (𝜎2). The third principal stress acts in the radial direction and has already been assumed to be zero. Figure 13.5 shows a plane stress element representing the stresses in the wall of a cylindrical thin-walled pressure vessel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.5: The hoop stress represents the first principal stress 𝜎1. The axial stress represents the second principal stress 𝜎2. There is no shear stress.\n\n\n\nBy the methods of Chapter 12 we may perform stress transformation on these stresses.

The 3rd principal stress 𝜎3 = 0.\n\n\n\nSince the two principal stresses are positive and the third principal stress is zero it should be apparent that the maximum in plane shear stress can be determined as:\n\\[\n\\tau_{max~in~plane}=\\frac{\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2}{2}\n\\]\nIt should also be apparent that the maximum out-of-plane shear stress will be larger and can be calculated from:\n\\[\n\\tau_{\\max a b s}=\\frac{\\sigma_1}{2}\n\\]\nExample 13.1 demonstrates calculation of the principal stresses and maximum in-plane shear stress for a cylindrical thin-walled pressure vessel.

Draw a stress element of a point on the pressure vessel. The axial stress will act horizontally and the hoop stress vertically for this element.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe weld is at an angle of 25° measured counter-clockwise from horizontal. The normal stress perpendicular to this weld is therefore at an angle of 65° clockwise from horizontal.

A thin walled pressure vessel is one where \\(\\frac{\\text { Inner radius }}{\\text { Wall thickness }}&gt;10\\).\nFor thin walled pressure vessels, the stresses in the vessel walls are assumed to be constant across the thickness of the wall and the stress in the radial direction is assumed to be zero. The stresses created in the axial and hoop directions by the fluid pressure are the principal stresses.\nPressure vessels are commonly cylindrical or spherical. Cylindrical vessels experience both axial and hoop stresses. The axial stress is half of the hoop stress. Spherical vessels experience only an axial stress. As such, spherical vessels experience less stress than cylindrical vessels.\nThere is no shear stress generated in the axial and hoop directions.

They will be reframed in terms of general axes so as to clarify which other stresses they may combine with. In Section 14.1.1 we will revisit bending stress to express the unsymmetric bending stress equation in terms of general cross-sectional axes (recall in Chapter 9, the cross-sectional axes were always y and z). In Section 14.1.2, eccentric loading, which is a specific instance of combined normal stress in which normal forces result in bending, will be considered.\nIn Section 14.2, we will focus on combining the various sources of shear stress to determine the total shear stress. To expand on the concepts discussed and used in Chapter 6 and Chapter 10, we will perform calculations based on both possible transverse loading directions as well as torsion. As in Section 14.1, this will be done with a general set of coordinate axes.\nIn Section 14.3, we will further expand the above cases to situations in which all combinations of loading are possible and the general stress state is determined.\nNote that the determination of the internal reactions for the general problems presented in this chapter will require the use of 3D equilibrium equations, particularly for determining bending moments and torsion. You may find it helpful to review Section 1.3 to understand these calculations.",

    "text": "14.1 Combined Normal Stress\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nAll forms of normal stress previously discussed act in the longitudinal (also referred to as axial) direction except for the hoop stress from pressure. The longitudinal direction is the direction normal to the cross-sectional location of the point for which stress is being evaluated.\nTo be able to discuss directions and stress components in general terms, we will consider the loadings and stresses in terms of the longitudinal direction (L) at the point in the structure being considered, the centroidal vertical axis of the cross-section (V), and the centroidal horizontal axis of the cross-section (H). The specific axes that these terms refer to depends on how the axes are specified generally for a structure as well as the location of the point in question.\nFor example, consider the structure in Figure 14.1 with the x, y, z axes oriented at the origin as shown. For point P on the structure, the longitudinal axis is the x-axis and the vertical and horizontal axes of the cross-section are the y-axis and z-axis, respectively. On the other hand, for point Q, the longitudinal axis is the y-axis and the vertical and horizontal axes of the cross-section are the z-axis and x-axis, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: The longitudinal (L), horizontal (H), and vertical (V) axes depend on how the axes are arranged globally for the structure as well as the specific location of the point in question.\n\n\n\nWe have seen that axial load, bending moments, and pressure all result in normal stresses. We can express the 2D normal stress state for any given point as:\n\\[\n\\sigma_L=\\frac{\\sum F_L}{A}+\\sigma_{bending}+\\frac{p r}{2 t}\n\\]\nin the longitudinal direction and:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{hoop}=\\frac{p r}{t}\n\\]\nin the direction of the other planar axis of the point in question. For the example given in Figure 14.1, both points are in the x-y plane, but the hoop direction is the y direction for point P and the x direction for point Q.\nIn the above stress equation, FL is the total force in the direction normal to the cross-section (same direction as the longitudinal direction). It is positive if the total normal force is tensile and negative if compressive. In addition, A is the cross-sectional area, p is the internal pressure, r is the inside radius of a pipe, and t is the wall thickness of a pipe. The pressure term will always be positive for internal pressure. Of course, for a solid cross-section, or a hollow cross-section with no pressure, the hoop stress and the last term of the longitudinal stress would be 0.\nTo help break down this analysis, Section 14.1.1 presents further clarification on finding bending stress for general coordinate axes. Section 14.1.2 discusses the specific combined loading case of an axial force that also results in bending.\n\n14.1.1 Generalized Bending Stress Equation\nIn Section 9.1 , an equation for bending stress based on having bending around the cross-sectional axes of y and z was derived. That equation is:\n\\[\n\\sigma_x=-\\frac{M_z y}{I_z}+\\frac{M_y z}{I_y}\n\\]\nThe negative sign in front of the Mz expression and the plus in front of the My expression are specifically related to the y and z cross-sectional axes as oriented as they were in Chapter 9, with the z-axis positive horizontally to the left and the y axis positive vertically upwards. However, because cross-sectional axes for any given point on a structure can vary based on both how the global axes are specified and on the location of the point within the structure, we will need to know how to apply the bending stress equation for a general set of axes before we can combine this stress with other sources of normal stress.\nIn any given loading situation, the bending moments are the moments around the cross-sectional centroidal axes. If the cross-sectional centroidal axes are thought of generally as the vertical axis (V) and the horizontal axis (H) as shown in Figure 14.2, the resulting stress would be in the longitudinal direction (L), and we can express the unsymmetric bending stress equation as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma_{L(bending})= \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_V d_H}{I_V}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_H d_V}{I_H}\\right|}\n\\tag{14.1}\\]\nwhere\n𝜎𝐿 = Bending stress in the longitudinal direction [Pa, psi]\nMV = Bending moment around the vertical axis [N⸱m, lb⸱in.]\nMH = Bending moment around the horizontal axis [N⸱m, lb⸱in.]\ndH = Horizontal distance between the point on the cross-section for which the stress is being calculated and the V axis [m, in.]\ndV = Vertical distance between the point on the cross-section for which the stress is being calculated and the H axis [m, in.]\nIV = the moment of inertia about the vertical axis [m4, in.4]\nIH = Area moment of inertia about the horizontal axis [m4, in.4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.2: General coordinate axes and the distances used in the bending stress equation\n\n\n\nThe sign on each individual term needs to be determined by inspection of the bending direction. The side of the cross section that would be on the “inside” of the bend will be in compression and vice versa. Figure 14.3 illustrates the sense of the bending moment around the horizontal axis that would result in compression above the H axis and tension below. Figure 14.4 illustrates the sense of bending moment around the vertical axis that would result in tension to the left of the V axis and compression to the right. The bending moment is shown for a section above and below a cut on a vertical structure and to the left and right of a cut on a horizontally oriented structure. The opposite directions of bending moment would lead to the opposite signs of stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.3: Sense of bending moment around the horizontal (H) axis that would result in tension below the H axis and compression above\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.4: Sense of bending moment around the vertical (V) axis that results in tension to the left of the V axis and compression to the right\n\n\n\nIf visualization is difficult, one can use the following tool:\n\nDraw the applied moment arrows around the V and H axes on the cross-section in the correct sense. Make sure to draw them such that they go over (or in front of) the bending axis (as opposed to under or behind)\nThe side (top/bottom for moments around the H axis and left/right for the moments around the V axis) the arrows point into are the compressive sides and the sides the tails of the arrows are on are the tensile sides.\n\nThe use of this tool will be demonstrated for the bending stress calculation in Example 14.1.\nIt will also be helpful to note that the bending stress for a point that lies directly on a centroidal axis will be zero for bending around that axis since the bending axis is the neutral axis for that direction of bending, as shown in Figure 14.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.5: Bending moments cause zero stress along the centroidal axis that they act around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.1  \n\n\nThe internal bending moments on a 32 mm diameter solid steel rod are found to be Mx = 376 kN mm and Mz = 204 kN mm as shown. Determine the bending stress at points P and Q.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing the cross-section, we can see that the vertical axis of the cross section is the z-axis and the horizontal axis of the cross section is the x-axis. The resulting stress is in the longitudinal direction, which is the y-axis. The bending stress equation can then be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\sigma_y= \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_z x}{I_z}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_x z}{I_x}\\right|\n\\]\nThe magnitudes of the bending moments are given. With the circular cross-section, the moment of inertia of both cross-sectional axes are:\n\\[\nI_x=I_y=\\frac{\\pi}{4} r^4=\\frac{\\pi}{4}(16{~mm})^4=51.47 \\times 10^3{~mm}^4=51.47 \\times 10^{-9}{~m}^4\n\\]\nFor point P, because it is on the centroidal z-axis, we know that it experiences no stress from Mz. Given the clockwise bending moment around the x-axis, the beam can be visualized as bending in a manner such that point P will be on the “inside” of the bend, or in compression.\nIf the visualization is difficult, we can also use the “tool” described in Section 14.1. Noting that the applied moment in this case is in the same direction as the bending moment (since equilibrium dictates that the moment at the fixed support is opposite of what is applied and the bending moment is opposite of the fixed support, we can conclude that the bending moment and applied moment would be in the same direction), we can draw the moment arrow across the cross-section. Note that this arrow should be drawn going over the x-axis. Drawing the arrow on the cross-section in this way, we can see that the arrowhead would point towards P, so all points above the x-axis, including P, are in compression from this moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe z distance from the x-axis to be P is the radius. We can then calculate the normal stress at point P to be:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{yP}=-\\left|\\frac{M_x z}{I_x}\\right|=-\\frac{376{~N}\\cdot{m}*(0.016{~m})}{51.47 \\times 10^{-9}{~m}^4}=-117{~MPa}\n\\]\nSimilarly, point Q will experience no stress from Mx since it is on the x-axis, but it will feel stress from Mz. The x distance from the z-axis to point Q is also the radius. The sign on the stress can be determined by visualizing the bending to be as shown in the front view below and noting that point Q would be on the outside part of the bend. Alternatively, drawing the moment arrow on the cross-section as was done for point P above reveals that point Q is on the tail side of the arrow, so in tension.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normal stress at point Q is thus calculated to be:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{y Q}=+\\left|\\frac{M_z x}{I_z}\\right|=\\frac{204{~N}\\cdot{m}*(0.016{~mm})}{51.47 \\times 10^{-9}{~m}^4}=63.4{~MPa}\n\\]\nσyP = 116.9 MPa (compression)\nσyQ = 63.4 MPa (tension)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.1.2 Eccentric Loading\nWhen the line of action of an axial load does not pass through the centroid of a cross section, it will result in both a normal reaction force and a bending moment. For example, consider the traffic light and corresponding free body diagram shown in Figure 14.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.6: The vertical pole is subject to direct axial stress and bending stress\n\n\n\nThe vertical support pole is subjected to normal forces from the weights of the traffic lights (the weight of the horizontal poles, cameras, etc., are assumed to be negligible for this example) as well as to bending moments around both cross-sectional axes (x and z) that result from the fact that the weights are not directly centered on the centroidal axes of the support pole. The total normal stress in the longitudinal direction, σy, at any given point on the pole would be given by the stress from the total normal force (\\(\\frac{\\sum F_y}{A}\\)) plus the bending stress from the bending moment around the z axis that results from W1 and W2 and the bending moment around the x axis that results from W3.\nIn terms of the general axes discussed in Section 14.1.1, we have:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma_L= \\pm\\left|\\frac{F_L}{A}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_V d_H}{I_V}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_H d_V}{I_H}\\right|}\n\\tag{14.2}\\]\nwhere\n𝜎𝐿 = Bending stress in the longitudinal direction [Pa, psi]\nFL = Internal normal force in the longitudinal direction [N, lb]\nA = Cross-sectional area [m2, in.2]\nMV = Bending moment around the vertical axis [N⸱m, lb⸱in.]\nMH = Bending moment around the horizontal axis [N⸱m, lb⸱in.]\ndH = Horizontal distance between the point on the cross-section for which the stress is being calculated and the V axis [m, in.]\ndV = Vertical distance between the point on the cross-section for which the stress is being calculated and the H axis [m, in.]\nIV = the moment of inertia about the vertical axis [m4, in.4]\nIH = Area moment of inertia about the horizontal axis [m4, in.4]\nThe sign for the first term is positive if the total force is tensile (directed away from the cross-section) and negative if the total force is compressive (pointed towards the cross-section).\nExample 14.2 and Example 14.3 demonstrate the calculation of normal stress in eccentric loading problems.\nExample 14.4 goes through the process of calculating each of the components of normal stress and then combining them to determine the normal stress state at particular point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.2  \n\n\nThe structure is subjected to vertical forces as shown. Determine the total normal stress at points P and Q on the cross-section of the vertical portion of the structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe generalized normal stress equation is:\n\\[\n\\sigma_L= \\pm\\left|\\frac{F_L}{A}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_V d_H}{I_V}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_H d_V}{I_H}\\right|\n\\]\nIn this case, the longitudinal axis (L) is the y-axis. The vertical axis of the cross-section (V) is the z-axis and the horizontal axis (H) is the x-axis.\nTo apply the equation, the internal reactions N, Mx, and Mz are needed. Since the internal reactions remain constant along the vertical portion of the structure, we can cut anywhere along its length to determine these internal reactions. The reaction moment around the x axis, Mx, can be determined to be 0 by inspection since all the forces pass through the centroidal x-axis of the cross-section. When finding the bending moments, it is important to remember that the moments needed are the moments around the centroidal axes of the cross-section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\sum F_y=N-75{~lb}-50{~lb}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad N=125{~lb} \\\\\n\\sum M_z=(75{~lb}*15{~in.})-(50{~lb}*25{~in.})+M z=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad M z=125{~lb}\\cdot{in.}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nSince both N and Mz are positive, the respective directions drawn on the FBD are confirmed to be correct. Thus, the normal force is compressive (pointed towards the cut section) and the bending moment is counterclockwise around the z-axis.\nThe total normal stress at point P can then be calculated with the following inputs:\n\\(F_L = N = 125{~lbs}\\)\n\\(A = 6{~in.}*8{~in.} = 48{~in.^2}\\)\n\\(M_V = M_x = 125{~lb}\\cdot{in.}\\)\n\\(d_x =\\text{ x-distance between point P and the z-axis} = 2{~in.}\\)\n\\(I_z = \\frac{1}{12}*(6{~in.})*(8{~in.^3}) = 256{~in.^4}\\)\nThe normal force N is compressive, so that term in the stress equation is made negative. With the counter-clockwise bending moment on the upper section, one can visualize that the bending would take on a “C” shape with point P on the outside of the bend, so point P would be in tension from the bending moment and that term in the equation is made positive.\nAs mentioned in Section 14.1.1, another way to determine the sign on the bending stress is to draw the direction of the overall applied moment on the cross-section. In this case, the total applied moment around the z-axis is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nM=(75{~lb}*15{~in.})-(50{~lb}*25{~in.})&=-125{~lb}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n&=125{~lb}\\cdot{in.}~~\\text{clockwise }\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nDrawing the clockwise moment on the cross-section we see that the left side of the cross-section is on the tail side of the arrow, so we can conclude that all points to the left of the centroidal z-axis will be in tension. Note that for this tool to work, the arrow must always be drawn to be going “over” the axis as opposed to under.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_{yP}=-\\left|\\frac{125{~lb}}{48{~in.^2}}\\right|+\\left|\\frac{(125{~lb}\\cdot{in.})(2{~in.})}{256{~in.^4}}\\right| \\\\\n\\sigma_{yP}=-1.63{~psi}\n\\]\nThe negative answer indicates that the stress is compressive.\nTo calculate the stress at point Q, all inputs to the equation remain the same except for dx. The x distance between the centroidal z-axis and point Q is 4 in. In addition, the sign on the bending stress is negative instead of positive since point K is on the inside of the bend (or on the arrow side of the cross-section drawn with the applied moment). Thus,\n\\[\n\\sigma_{yQ}=-\\left|\\frac{125{~lb}}{48{~in.^2}}\\right|-\\left|\\frac{(125{~lb}\\cdot{in.})(4{~in.})}{256{~in.^4}}\\right| \\\\\n\\sigma_{yQ}=-4.56{~psi}\n\\]\nσyP = -3.49 psi, σyQ = -6.42 psi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.3  \n\n\nA force pulls up on point P on the post with rectangular cross section as shown. Determine the normal stress at point A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this problem, there are three sources of normal stress: the bending stress from bending around the y axis, the bending stress from bending around the x axis, and the axial stress from the 180 kN force acting normal to the cross-section.\nFor the given loading, the internal reactions will be the same for any z location, so we can make a cut anywhere to determine the bending moment and normal force reaction\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\sum M_X=(180{~kN}*50{~mm})+M_x=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad M_X=-9000{~kN}\\cdot{mm} \\\\\n&\\sum M_Z=(180{~kN}*40{~mm})+M_z=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad M_Z=-7200{~kN}\\cdot{mm} \\\\\n&\\sum F_Y=180{~kN}-N=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad N=180{~kN}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nBy inspection of the applied moments, we can visualize that the bending around the x-axis is such that the post would bend towards us and points along the back edge where point A is would be in tension.\nWe can also visualize that the bending around the z-axis is such that the post would bend in a backwards C shape and points to the left of the centroidal z-axis would be in compression. We can also observe the the normal force reaction is tensile.\nApplying the generalized normal stress equation (with the pressure term omitted):\n\\[\n\\sigma_{L A}= \\pm\\left|\\frac{F_L}{A}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_V d_H}{I_V}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_H d_V}{I_H}\\right|\n\\]\nIn this case, the longitudinal axis of the post is the y-axis, the vertical axis of the cross-section is the y-axis, and the horizontal axis of the cross-section is x-axis. The dH in the equation is the x distance between centroidal z-axis and point A. The dV in the equation is the z distance between the centroidal x-axis and point A.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\sigma_{yA}=\\left|\\frac{N}{A}\\right|-\\left|\\frac{M_z d_x}{I_z}\\right|+\\left|\\frac{M_x d_z}{I_x}\\right| \\\\\n&\\sigma_{yA}=\\left|\\frac{180,000{~N}}{(0.2{~m})(0.15{~m})}\\right| \\left|\\frac{7200{~N}\\cdot{m}*0.085{~m}}{\\frac{1}{12}(0.15{~m})(0.2 {~m})^3}\\right|+\\left| \\frac{9000{~N}\\cdot{m}*0.075{~m})}{\\frac{1}{12}(0.2{~m})(0.15{~m})^3}\\right| \\\\\n&\\sigma_{y A}=11.9{~MPa}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe stress works out to be positive and therefore tensile.\nσyA =11.9 MPa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.4  \n\n\nFor the pressurized pipe loaded as shown, determine the normal stresses at point H. Noting that there would be no shear stress at point H for this loading, represent the general stress state of point H on a stress element. The pipe has an outside diameter of 200 mm and a wall thickness of 10 mm. The load Pz = 18 kN and the internal pressure in the pipe is 1500 kPa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the general normal stress equation:\n\\[\n\\sigma_L= \\pm\\left|\\frac{F_L}{A}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_V d_H}{I_V}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_H d_V}{I_H}\\right| \\pm \\frac{p r}{2 t}\n\\]\nIn this problem, the longitudinal direction is the z direction and the horizontal and vertical axes of the cross-section where H is located are the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. Since there is pressure loading in this problem, there is also normal stress in the hoop direction (x and y-directions).\nSo we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma_{long} & = \\pm\\left|\\frac{F_z}{A}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{\\left|M_y d_x\\right|}{I_y}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{\\mid M_x d_y}{I_x}\\right| \\pm \\frac{p r}{2 t} \\\\\n\\sigma_{hoop} & =\\frac{p r}{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nCutting through the part of the pipe where point H is located and applying equilibrium provides the following results for the internal reactions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\sum F_y=N-18{~kN}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad N=18{~kN} \\\\\n&\\sum M_y=(18{~kN}*1.8{~m})+M_y=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad M_y=-32.4{~kN}\\cdot{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that force is only applied in the z-direction so no other force reactions were drawn. There is also no force that results in a moment around the x-axis or z-axis, so Mx and Mz were also omitted from the FBD.\nThe normal force is positive based on the drawn direction, so it is compressive. The bending moment around the y-axis was drawn counterclockwise around the y axis, but the result is negative, so the bending moment is actually clockwise.

    "text": "14.2 General Shear Stress\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nShear stress due to torsion was discussed in Chapter 6 while shear stress due to transverse loading was discussed in Chapter 10. In this section, the considerations that go into determining the total shear stress that arise when both forms of loading will be discussed.\n\n14.2.1 Shear Stress due to Torsion\nAs discussed in Section 6.1, shear stress due to torsion can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\tau_{(torsional)}=\\frac{T \\rho}{J}\n\\]\nFor general problems, one may need to calculate T, so it is important to remember that torque is the moment about the longitudinal axis of a body, or that component of the moment that causes the body to twist. Since this form of shear stress will be combined with transverse shear stress to get the total, understanding the sign on the shear stress will be important.\nRecall that when a stress element is drawn, a positive shear stress is one for which the shear stress arrow goes in the positive vertical direction on a positive vertical face and in the positive horizontal direction on a positive horizontal face. The positive or negative directions and faces are established by the positive sense of the axes which define the plane the point is in.\nTo determine which way a shear stress arrow would be drawn for a given stress element, one must cut the body at one edge of the stress element and visualize the direction in which the load would be applied across the cut.\nFor example, in Figure 14.7, when the cylinder is cut at the top of the stress element, we examine the bottom section of the cylinder and note that the reaction torque at the cut surface goes in the opposite direction to that which is applied at the bottom surface. This results in a counterclockwise reaction torque at the cut which means that the top section tends to want to twist (and exert a force) from left to right across the top element edge. If the vertical axis is positive upwards, the top face is a positive face. In addition, if the horizontal axis is positive to the right, the rightwards shear force arrow is in the positive direction. Together this means that the shear stress can be concluded to be positive since we would have a positive shear force on a positive face.\nSimilarly, when the cut is made at the bottom edge of the element, we can examine the top section of the cylinder for which equilibrium dictates that there is a clockwise reaction moment at the cut edge. This means that the bottom section tends to want twist from right to left across the bottom element edge. If the vertical axis is positive upwards so that the top face is a positive face, and the horizontal axis is positive to the right, the leftwards shear force would be a negative force acting on a negative face, so the shear stress would still be concluded to be positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.7: Signs for shear stress\n\n\n\n\n\n14.2.2 Shear Stress due to Transverse Shear\nIn Chapter 10, the equation \\(\\tau=\\frac{V Q}{I t}\\) was evaluated to find the shear stress due to transverse shear force V. In that chapter, only one direction of shear force was considered for each problem and the sign on shear stress was not considered. For general loading, we may have two directions of transverse shear force corresponding to the two cross-sectional axes directions, as shown in Figure 14.8, so we will need to apply the transverse shear stress equation for both directions and also understand the signs so that we can combine them with each other and with the torsional shear stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.8: Shear forces in two directions on cross-section\n\n\n\nWhen applying the transverse shear stress equations for specific directions of shear force, it is helpful to keep the following in mind:\n\nThe cut one makes to determine the first moment of area Q will be perpendicular to the direction of shear force.\nThe area moment of inertia will be the moment of inertia around the axis perpendicular to the shear force.\nThe thickness, as before, refers to the thickness of the solid part of the cross section that one cuts through to calculate Q.\n\nUsing the same reference axes as with the general normal stress equation (H for horizontal centroidal axis and V for vertical centroidal axis), the transverse shear stress equation can be written as follows:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\tau_{(transverse)}= \\pm\\left|\\frac{V_H Q_V}{I_V t_V}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{V_V Q_H}{I_H t_H}\\right|}\n\\tag{14.3}\\]\nwhere\n𝜏(transverse) = Transverse shear stress at point of interest [Pa, psi]\nVH = Internal horizontal shear force [N, lb]\nVV = Internal vertical shear force [N, lb]\nQV = First moment of area about the vertical axis passing through the point of interest [m3, in.3]\nQH = First moment of area about the horizontal axis passing through the point of interest [m3, in.3]\nIV = Area moment of inertia about the vertical centroidal axis [m4, in.4]\nIH = Area moment of inertia about the horizontal centroidal axis [m4, in.4]\ntV = Vertical thickness of the cross-section [m, in.]\ntH = Horizontal thickness of the cross-section [m, in.]\nThe signs on the shear stress are determined similarly to the manner described in Section 14.2.1 for torsion. The direction of the internal shear force is determined by equilibrium and this direction relative to the positive axes and faces on the stress element are used to establish direction.\nIt will be helpful to note that for any point on a cross-section that is on an edge that a transverse shear force goes through (or for a circular cross-section, any point on the outer diameter that lies in the path of the force), the transverse shear stress due to that direction of shear force is 0. This is illustrated in Figure 14.9. This is because the specified points would be on free surfaces in these cases. For example, for a vertical shear force, the bending would be around the horizontal axis, so the top and bottom surfaces would be considered free surfaces with no shear force acting above the top surface or below the bottom surface. The same would hold true for the left and right surfaces in the case of a horizontal shear forces that would result in bending around the vertical axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.9: Locations of zero transverse shear stress\n\n\n\nExample 14.5 demonstrates the calculation of transverse shear stress with multiple directions of shear force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.5  \n\n\nTwo forces are applied to a rectangular post as shown. Determine the shear stress at points P and S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find shear stresses at points P and Q, which are at the same vertical location on the post, we must first cut the post at that vertical location and find the internal reactions by applying equilibrium. The illustration below shows the section below the cut made at the cross-section where points P and Q are located. The reactions at the support due to the applied loading must be in the opposite direction to the loading for equilibrium and the internal reactions at the cut section will be opposite to the support reactions. Note that there are also bending moments around the x and y axes due to the applied forces, but those result in normal stress, not shear stress.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that there is no torsion in this problem, the general shear stress equation can be written:\n\\[\n\\tau= \\pm\\left|\\frac{V_H Q_V}{I_V t_V}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{V_V Q_H}{I_H t_H}\\right|\n\\]\nWhere the horizontal axis of the cross-section is the y–axis and the vertical axis of the cross section is the x-axis.\nFor any point on the cross-section, we can substitute:\n\\(V_H = V_y = 78{~kN}\\)\n\\(V_V = V_x = 94{~kN}\\)\n\\(I_H=I_y=\\frac{1}{12}(160{~mm})^3(120{~mm})=40.96 \\times 10^6{~mm}^4=40.96 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^4\\)\n\\(I_V=I_x=\\frac{1}{12}(120{~mm})^3(160{~mm})=23.04 \\times10^6{~mm}^4=23.04 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^4\\)\nThe Q and the t terms will depend on the specific points on the cross-section.\nPoint P:\nThe x faces of the post (front and back sides) do not feel shear stress from Vx since Vx results in bending around the y-axis and the front and back sides would be free surfaces for such bending. In the shear stress equation, we can also see this from that fact that Qy = A’x’ would be zero for point P (A’ = 0 below the horizontal cut at H and x’ = 0 for the area above the cut).\nTo find the shear stress from Vy, we would make a vertical cut through point H and calculate\n\\[\nQ_x=A'y'=\\frac{1}{2}(160{~mm})(120{~mm})*\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(160{~mm})=384000{~mm}^3=384 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^3\n\\]\n\\(t_x = 120{~mm} = 0.12{~m}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the FBD of the cut section of the post drawn above, we can see that Vy goes across the top of the stress element of P in the positive y direction. The top of the element is on the positive z-face, so we a positive force on a positive face, which makes the resulting shear stress positive.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo\n\\[\n\\tau_P=\\frac{V_y Q_x}{I_x t_x}=\\frac{(78000{~N})(384 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^3)}{(40.96 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^4)(0.12{~m})}=6.09{~MPa}\n\\]\nPoint S:\nFor point S, the shear stress from Vy will be zero by the same reasoning as used for point P and Vx (Qx = 0 for point S), so we only need to calculate the shear stress from Vx.\nTo find the shear stress from Vx, we would make a horizontal cut through point S and calculate\n\\[\nQ y=A'x'=(160{~mm})(30{~mm})*(60{~mm}-15{~mm})=216000{~mm}^3=216 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^3\n\\]\n\\(t_y = 160{~mm} = 0.16{~m}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain looking at the FBD of the cut post above, we can see that Vx goes across the top of the stress element for S in the negative x direction. So we a negative force on a positive face, which makes the resulting shear stress negative\n\n\n\n\n\nSo\n\\[\n\\tau_S=-\\frac{V_x Q_y}{I_y t_y}=-\\frac{(94000{~N})(216 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^3)}{(23.04 \\times 10^{-6}{~m}^4)(0.16{~m})}=-5.51{~MPa}\n\\]\nτP = 6.09 MPa, τS = -5.51 MPa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.2.3 Combined Shear Stress\nNow we can consider the case of bodies having both torsion and transverse shear stresses. Given a general loading, one may need to calculate the torque and also identify which of the forces constitute transverse shear forces. It will be helpful to remember that the transverse shear forces are the forces in the directions of the cross-sectional axes and torsion is that component of moment that is about the longitudinal axis.\nThe total shear stress equation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\tau= \\pm\\left|\\frac{T \\rho}{J}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{V_H Q_V}{I_V t_V}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{V_V Q_H}{I_H t_H}\\right|}\n\\tag{14.4}\\]\nwhere\n𝜏 = Shear stress at point of interest [Pa, psi]\nT = Internal torque [N·m, lb·in.]\n𝜌 = Radial distance from centroid to point of interest [m, in.]\nJ = Polar moment of inertia [m4, in.4]\nVH = Internal horizontal shear force [N, lb]\nVV = Internal vertical shear force [N, lb]\nQV = First moment of area about the vertical axis passing through the point of interest [m3, in.3]\nQH = First moment of area about the horizontal axis passing through the point of interest [m3, in.3]\nIV = Area moment of inertia about the vertical centroidal axis [m4, in.4]\nIH = Area moment of inertia about the horizontal centroidal axis [m4, in.4]\ntV = Vertical thickness of the cross-section [m, in.]\ntH = Horizontal thickness of the cross-section [m, in.]\nExample 14.6 demonstrates the calculation of total shear stress when torsion and transverse shear are both acting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.6  \n\n\nA solid steel bar with an outside diameter of 6.70 in. is loaded as shown. Determine the maximum shear stress at points J and K on the outside of the pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we need to find the internal reactions at the location of the points in question. To find the internal reactions, we will first draw the whole body FBD and apply equilibrium to find the reactions at the support. Then we will cut the body at the location of points J,K and apply equilibrium to the cut section to find the internal reactions. All the reactions are calculated below even though we only need Vx, Vz, and My to find the shear stresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find reactions at support:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum F_x=R_x+1500{lb}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad R_x=-1500{~lb} \\\\\n& \\sum F_y=R_y=0 \\\\\n& \\sum F_z=R_z+900{~lb}=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad R_z=-900{~lb}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum M_x=M_{Rx}+(900{~lb})(80{~in.})=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad M_{Rx}=-72,000{~lb}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n& \\sum M_y=M_{Ry}+(900{~lb})(18{~in.})=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad M_{Ry}=-16,200{~lb}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n& \\sum M_z=M_{Rz}-(1500{~lb})(80{~in.})=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad {Mz}=120,000{~lb}\\cdot{in.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo find reactions at cut section:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum F_x=R_x+V_x=-1500{~lb}+V x=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad V x=1500{~lb} \\\\\n& \\sum F_y=R_y+V_y=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad V y=0 \\\\\n& \\sum F_z=R_z+V_z=-900{~lb}+V_z=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad V_z=900{~lb}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum M_x=M_{Rx}+V_z(10{~in.})+M_x=-72,000{~lb}\\cdot{in.}+900{~lb}(10{~in.})+M_x=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad M_x=63,000{~lb}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n& \\sum M_y=M_{Ry}+M_y=-16,200{~lb}\\cdot{in}+M_y=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad M_y=16,200{~lb}\\cdot{in.} \\\\\n& \\sum M_z=M_{Rz}-V_x(10{~in.})+M_z=120,000{~lb}\\cdot{in.}-1500{~lb}(10{~in.})+M_z=0 \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad M_z=-105,000{~lb}\\cdot{in.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe longitudinal direction based on the part of the rod on the y-axis is the y-axis, so the torsional moment is My. Both points J and K will experience the same magnitude of shear stress from the torsion, however, it is possible for the signs to be different for the two different points depending on orientation. The magnitude of the shear stress is:\n\\[\n\\tau_{torsion}= \\pm\\left|\\frac{Tc}{J}\\right|=\\pm\\left|\\frac{M_y(c)}{J}\\right|= \\pm\\left|\\frac{16,200{~lb}\\cdot{in.}*(3.35{~in.})}{\\frac{\\pi}{32}(6.7{~in.})^4}\\right|= \\pm 274{~psi}\n\\]\nConsidering the stress element for each point with the counterclockwise torque resulting in a downwards directed force across the cut face of the element, we can note that there would be a negative z force on a positive y face for point K and a positive x force on a positive y face for point J. So\n\\(τ_{K(torsion)} = - 274{~psi}~~\\text and~~ τ_{J(torsion)} = + 274{~psi}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow turning our attention to the shear stresses from the transverse forces, we note the cross sectional axes are the x- and z-axes, so the transverse shear forces are those that are in the x- and z-directions. We can also note that with K being on the x-axis of the cross section, it will not experience transverse shear stress from Vx. Similarly, point J will not experience transverse shears tress from Vy. In addition, since the cross-section is circular, we know that for both points:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Q_{max}=\\frac{1}{12} d^3=\\frac{1}{12}(6.7{~in.})^3=25.06{~in.^3} \\\\\n& t=d=6.7{~in.}^3 \\\\\n& I_x=I_z=\\frac{\\pi}{64} d^4=\\frac{\\pi}{64}(6.7{in.})^4=98.92{~in.^4} \\\\\n&\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince Vz acts in the positive z direction on the positive y face for point K, the transverse shear stress for point K is positive. Since Vx acts in the positive x direction on the y face for point Y, the transverse shear stress for point J is also positive.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\tau_{K(transverse)}= \\pm\\left|\\frac{V_z Q_{circle}}{I_{circle} d}\\right|=+\\frac{900{~lb}(25.06{~in.}^3)}{98.92{~in.}^4(6.7 {~in})}=34.03{~psi} \\\\\n& \\tau_{J(transverse)}= \\pm\\left|\\frac{V_x Q_{circle}}{I_{circle} d}\\right|=+\\frac{1500{~lb}(25.06{~in.}^3)}{98.92{~in.}^4(6.7 {~in.})}=56.72{~psi}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFinally, we can calculate the total shear stress for each point by summing the torsional shear stress with the transverse shear stress:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\tau_K=\\tau_{(torsion)}+\\tau_{(tranverse)}=-274.3{~psi}+34.03{~psi}=-240.27{~psi} \\\\\n& \\tau_J=\\tau_{(torsion)}+\\tau_{(tranverse)}=274.3{~psi}+56.72{~psi}=331.02{~psi}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nτK = -240.27 psi, τJ = 331.02 psi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Combined shear stress\n\n\n\n\nCut the body at the location of the point of interest and determine the internal reactions at that point.\nNote that for this text, this step will apply to round shafts only.

    "text": "14.3 General Combined Stress\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nOnce the total normal stress and total shear stress at a specified point is calculated, the general stress state can be represented on a stress element and used to determine principal stresses, principal planes, and max/min shear stresses.\nIn Example 14.7, the problem from Example 14.5 is extended to find the principal stresses and max/min shear stresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14.7  \n\n\nRevisit Example 14.5 to find the principal stresses and max/min shear stresses for point P on the post:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Example 14.5 the total shear stress for point P was found to be positive 6.094 MPa.\nTo find the principal stresses, we must finish finding the general stress state by also finding the normal stresses and then use the principal stress equations or Mohr’s Circle.\nThe normal stress for this problem only arises from the bending around the x- and y-axes (the cross-sectional axes) since there is no force in the longitudinal z-direction and there is no pressure involved. The bending stress will be in the z-direction since that is the longitudinal direction.\nIn addition, since P is on the x-axis, it will experience no stress from the moment around the x-axis, Mx, so all the normal stress comes from the bending around the y axis, My.\nAs discussed in Example 14.5, if we consider the FBD of the section cut at P shown below, we know by inspection that the internal reactions at P will be the same magnitude and direction as the applied. This is because the reactions at the support will be equal and opposite to the applied and the internal reactions are the opposite of those.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe internal moment reaction around the y-axis, My, can then be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum M_y=(-94{~kN})(150{~mm})&=-14,100{~kN}\\cdot{mm} \\\\\n&=14,100{~kN}\\cdot{mm}~~\\text{clockwise}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe bending stress for point P will be positive since the clockwise moment around the y-axis means that the post will curve into the plane of the screen and look as shown below from the positive y side view. The cross-section is also shown with the tail of the representative moment arrow on the P side of the cross-section, indicating that everything below the y-axis will be in tension.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecalling \\(I_y = 40.96 \\times 10^{-6}{~m^4}\\) from Example 14.5, the normal stress at P is then:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{P z}=\\frac{M_y x}{I_y}=\\frac{14,100{~N}\\cdot{m}(0.06{~m})}{40.96 \\times 10^{-6}{~m^4}}=20.7{~MPa}\n\\]\nNow that the total shear stress and total normal stress are known, the stress state can be represented on a stress element.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying the simplified version of the principal stress equations and the max/min shear equation (in terms of the general xy plane), we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sigma_{1,2}=\\frac{\\sigma_x+\\sigma_y}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2+\\tau_{x y}{ }^2} \\\\\n& \\tau_{\\max , \\min }= \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_x-\\sigma_y}{2}\\right)^2+\\tau_{x y}{ }^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn this case, since the point P is in the y-z plane instead of the x-y plane, we can replace the x subscripts with y and the y subscripts with z, so the equations become:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sigma_{1,2}=\\frac{\\sigma_y+\\sigma_z}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_y-\\sigma_z}{2}\\right)^2+\\tau_{y z}^2}=\\frac{20.7{~MPa}+0}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{20.7{~MPa}-0}{2}\\right)^2+(6.094{~MPa})^2}=22.26{~MPa},-1.661{~MPa} \\\\\n& \\tau_{\\max , \\min }= \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_y-\\sigma_z}{2}\\right)^2+\\tau_{y z}^2}=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{20.7{~MPa}-0}{2}\\right)^2+(6.094{~MPa})^2}=12.01{~MPa},-12.01{~MPa}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nσ1 = 22.36 MPa\nσ2 = 22.36 MPa\nτmin = -12.01 MPa\nτmax = 12.01 MPa",

Normal forces are the forces perpendicular to the cross-section the point in question is on. These are also the forces in the longitudinal direction. The bending moment contribution to normal stress comes from bending moments around the centroidal cross-sectional axes. Both normal forces and bending moments will result in stress in the longitudinal direction with respect to the location of the cross-section.\nPressure will result in normal stress in two directions (hoop and axial). The axial stress will combine with the normal stress from normal forces and bending moments to result in an overall longitudinal stress. The hoop stress will be the only stress in that direction for the situations considered in this text.\nSince the stresses are added together, it is important to also understand the sign of each stress. Compressive stresses are negative and tensile stresses are positive. In bending, one can visualize the bending shape of a body to determine if a point will be in tension or compression or use the visual aid described in Section 14.1.1. Internal pressure will always be tensile.\nThe combined shear stress at a point comes from torsion and transverse shear forces. The torsional moment is the moment about the longitudinal axis. The transverse shear forces are the forces in the directions of the cross-sectional axes. The signs for shear stress are determined by drawing the stress element and considering the direction of the internal torque or shear force on the cut edge of the element relative to the positive and negative faces of the element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey equations\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_L= \\pm\\left|\\frac{F_L}{A}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_V d_H}{I_V}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{M_H d_V}{I_H}\\right|+\\frac{p r}{2 t}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma_{hoop}=\\frac{p r}{t}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\tau= \\pm\\left|\\frac{T c}{J}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{V_H Q_V}{I_V t_V}\\right| \\pm\\left|\\frac{V_V Q_H}{I_H t_H}\\right|\n\\]\nwhere\nL = longitudinal axis\nV = vertical centroidal axis of cross-section\nH = horizontal centroidal axis of cross-section",

While these aspects are crucial, it’s equally important to ensure the structure’s stability. In this chapter, we will delve into the stability analysis of long and slender members subjected to compressive loading, commonly referred to as columns. Some examples are shown in Figure 15.1. When the compressive load reaches a critical point, columns may undergo sudden sideways deflection, a phenomenon known as buckling.  After buckling, a column is unable to support any further load. This chapter will focus on long, slender, homogeneous, axial compression members, otherwise known as columns.\nIn Section 15.1 we’ll derive the buckling formula for columns that are supported by pin connections at both ends.

    "text": "15.1 Euler’s Formula for Buckling\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nEven in ideal conditions, buckling often occurs for long slender members at loads significantly lower than the material’s crushing or compression limit. When a long slender object is subjected to axial loading, it may buckle once the load reaches a critical threshold known as the critical load, Pcr. At this point, the object experiences significant lateral deflection perpendicular to the load direction, so columns should be designed such that the applied load does not exceed the critical load.\nBuckling of a ruler (long slender member) is depicted in Figure 15.2. The ruler in the left and center photos is subjected to axial load P that is less than the critical load, Pcr. This is known as stable equilibrium. In the photo on the right, the axial load, P, exceeded the critical load Pcr, causing a significant lateral deflection. This is known as unstable equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.2: Buckling of a ruler.\n\n\n\n\n15.1.1 Stability\nWe can consider stability by using a simplified model of a pinned-pinned column. This column will consist of two ridged bars connected with a pin and a spring with a stiffness k, as shown in Figure 15.3 (A). When the load, P, is small, the system remains vertical, and the spring is unstretched. If point C is displaced to the right a small amount, Δ, the spring will produce a force F = kΔ, as shown in Figure 15.3 (B). This force is used to resist the horizontal forces, Px = Ptanθ, as shown in Figure 15.3 (C).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.3: Free body diagram of a simplified column\n\n\n\nSince θ is small:\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta \\sim \\theta \\text { and } \\tan \\theta \\sim \\theta\n\\]\nso\n\\[\n\\Delta=\\theta \\frac{L}{2} \\text { and } 2 P_x=2 P \\theta\n\\]\nUsing the spring restoring force equation F=kΔ, then substituting in for Δ we have:\n\\[\nF=k \\theta \\frac{L}{2}\n\\]\nIf the spring restoring force is greater than the axial force, then we have a stable equilibrium.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& F&gt;P \\\\\n& k \\theta \\frac{L}{2}&gt;2 P \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe θ cancels out, and we can solve for P:\n\\[\nP&lt;\\frac{k L}{4}\n\\]\nSimilarly we can solve for the expression for unstable equilibrium F &lt; P:\n\\[\nP&gt;\\frac{k L}{4}\n\\]\nThe point at which F = P is crucial as it is the line between stable and unstable equilibrium. We call this the critical load Pcr:\n\\[\nP_{c r}=\\frac{k L}{4}\n\\]\nThus, if the load P exceeds Pcr, then the system will be unstable, and if P is less than Pcr, then the system will be stable. We will use Pcr in the next section to determine the bucking load of columns.\n\n\n15.1.2 Euler’s Formula\nAs mentioned in earlier sections, members can fail due to material yielding or fracturing. However, instability represents another critical failure mechanism that requires consideration. We will use Euler’s formula to calculate the theoretical buckling load. To do this, we will start with the simplest of columns, pinned-pinned end connections. This means that the column cannot translate but can rotate as shown in Figure 15.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.4: Pinned-pinned axially loaded column.\n\n\n\nColumns are similar to beams rotated 90 degrees, so we can use what we already know about the elastic curve.\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}=\\frac{M}{E I}\n\\]\nWe can use the free-body diagram in Figure 15.4 (C) to sum moments about any point on the lower column section.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum M=0=M+P y \\\\\n& M=-P y\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can now substitute this expression into the elastic curve equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}=\\frac{-P y}{E I} \\\\\n& \\frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}+\\left(\\frac{P}{E I}\\right) y=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis is a linear, homogeneous, second-order differential equation with constant coefficients, which has a general solution of:\n\\[\ny=C_1 \\sin \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{E I}} x\\right)+C_2 \\cos \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{E I}} x\\right)\n\\]\nThe two constants, C1 and C2, can be determined by imploring boundary conditions.  Since y = 0 at x = 0 and y = 0 when x = L. The first condition gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&0  =C_1(0)+C_2(1) \\\\\n& C_2  =0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe second boundary condition, x = L when y = 0 results in:\n\\[\n0=C_1 \\sin \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{E I}} x\\right)+0\n\\]\nThe equation is satisfied if C1 = 0. However, this is a trivial solution that implies y = 0 and there is no lateral deflection. For the nontrivial solution, the sine function must be equal to zero, which requires:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{E I}} L=n \\pi \\\\\n& \\text {where } n=1, 2, 3, 4,...\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe smallest value of P occurs when n = 1; substituting this and rearranging gives us Euler’s formula:\n\\[\n\\boxed{P_{c r}=\\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L^2}}\n\\tag{15.1}\\]\nwhere:\nPcr = critical axial load on the column just before it buckles [N, lb]. Note that this load must be less than that of the load that would cause the stress in the columns to exceed the yield stress, or the column will fail due to yield stress before it buckles.\nE = Elastic modulus of the material [Pa, psi]\nI = Area moment of inertia for the column [m4, in.4]. Note if Ix and Iy are different, use the smaller value.\nL = Unsupported length of the column  (pinned=pinned connection) [m, in.]\nThis is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler who developed this formula in 1744. Other bucking modes can exist (n = 2, n = 3, n = 4, etc.) but are less common as the load required for those higher modes would be much larger. The first three bucking loads can be seen in Figure 15.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.5: First three buckling modes\n\n\n\n\n\n15.1.3 Bucking Direction\nColumns that are pinned at both ends and have circular or square cross sections (where the moments of inertia are the same about any axis) could buckle in any direction. However, columns that do not have a symmetric cross-section will take place in the plane perpendicular to the principal axis of the minimum moment of inertia. For example, the ruler in Figure 15.2 has a rectangular cross-section. When a compressive force is applied to the ruler, it will buckle about the axis with the smaller moment of inertia. The axis of bucking might not be obvious for sections that are not symmetric. During buckling analysis, it’s essential to evaluate both directions to determine the axis with the lowest moment of inertia. Subsequently, this axis is utilized for computing the critical buckling load. Figure 15.6 illustrates column buckling of wood supports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.6: Buckling of wooden studs.\n\n\n\n\n\n15.1.4 Critical Stress\nWe can use the Euler bucking equation to calculate the critical stress for a column by setting I=Ar2 where A is the cross-sectional area and r is the radius of gyration. For a more comprehensive discussion on the radious of gyration, see the Engineering Statics book by Baker and Haynes.\n\\[\n\\sigma_{c r}=\\frac{P_{c r}}{A}=\\frac{\\pi^2 E\\left(A r^2\\right)}{A L^2}\n\\]\nRearranging we have:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma_{c r}=\\frac{\\pi^2 E}{\\left(\\frac{L}{r}\\right)^2}}\n\\tag{15.2}\\]\nwhere\nσcr = critical stress on the column just before it buckles [Pa, psi]. Note that this stress must be less than that of the yield stress, or the column will fail due to yield stress before it buckles.\nE = Elastic modulus of the material [Pa, psi]\nL = Unsupported length of the column (pinned=pinned connection) [m, in.]\nr = Smallest radius of gyration of the column [m, in.]\nThe quantity in the denominator, L/r, is called the slenderness ratio of the column. Many times columns are classified using the slenderness ratio as short, intermediate, and long. The smallest value of the radius of gyration is used to find the critical stress.\nA plot of the critical stress versus the slenderness ratio is shown in Figure 15.7. For larger slenderness ratios the curve is hyperbolic. For smaller slenderness ratios, the critical stress is equal to the yield stress of the material. This graph illustrates that if the critical stress calculated using Euler’s equation is greater than the yield stress that is of no interest. The column will yield before it has the chance to buckle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.7: Plot of critical stress.\n\n\n\nExample 15.1 demonstrates calculation of the critical buckling load and critical buckling stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 15.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 15.1  \n\n\nA pinned-pinned W10x30 column is 8 ft long made of A492 steel (σy = 50 ksi and E = 29,000 ksi) What is the largest load axial load that this column can support?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will consult the table in Appendix A to get the section properties of a W10x30 section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& A=8.84{~in.}^2 \\\\\n& I_x=170{~in.}^4 \\\\\n& r_y=4.38{~in.} \\\\\n& I_y=16.7{~in.}^4 \\\\\n& r_y=1.37{~in.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe will start with calculating the critical load using Euler’s Bucking Formula.

    "section": "15.2 Effect of Supports",
    "text": "15.2 Effect of Supports\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nWe derived Euler’s equation for bucking with pinned-pinned supports (the simplest case). However, in many cases, columns are supported by other end conditions. Just as we derived Euler’s formula for bucking by solving a differential equation for the pinned-pinned conditions, the same can be done for other types of support cases. We will derive one more here.\nLet’s consider the case where a column is fixed at one end and free at the other end as shown in Figure 15.8 (A). Summing moments at the cut end of the free body diagram in Figure 15.8 (B) we get M=P(δ-y).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.8: Column with a fixed base and a free end.\n\n\n\nWe can now write the differential equation using the elastic curve equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E I \\frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}=P(\\delta-y) \\\\\n& \\frac{d^2 y}{d x^2}+\\left(\\frac{P}{E I}\\right) y=\\left(\\frac{P}{E I}\\right) \\delta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince the right side is not equal to zero, this equation is nonhomogeneous (note this differs from our earlier derivation for the pinned-pinned connection). There will be a particular and complementary solution.\n\\[\ny=C_1 \\sin \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{E I} x}\\right)+C_2 \\cos \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{E I} x}\\right)+\\delta\n\\]\nWe can now employ boundary conditions to solve for the constants. At x = 0, y = 0, so C2 = δ. Also at x = 0, dy/dx=0, so C1=0. This leads us to the following deflection curve:\n\\[\ny=\\delta\\left(1-\\cos \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{E I}} x\\right)\\right)\n\\]\nAt the free end of the column, x = L, we know that y = δ so:\n\\[\n0=\\delta \\cos \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{E I} L}\\right)\n\\]\nThe trivial solution δ = 0 shows that no matter what the P value no buckling will occur. So we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 0=\\cos \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{P}{E I} L}\\right) \\\\\n& \\sqrt{\\frac{P}{E I}} L=\\frac{n \\pi}{2} \\\\\n& \\text{where n=1, 3, 5,...}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe smallest critical load happens at n = 1, results in:\n\\[\nP_{c r}=\\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(2 L)^2}\n\\]\nOther support conditions can be derived in a similar manner.\n\n15.2.1 Effective Length\nThe critical load equation for the fixed-free column differs from the equation for the pinned-pinned column only by the length L being multiplied by a factor of 2. We will adjust the column length L to denote the distance between the points on the column where the moment is zero. This distance is referred to as the effective length, Le. For a pinned-pinned column, L = Le, as illustrated in Figure 15.9. As derived above, for a column with a fixed base and a free end, Le = 2L. Two other common end conditions are depicted in this figure relating L to Le. We can use one general equation for any support condition by replacing the effective length with KL, where K represents the effective length factor.\n\\[\n\\boxed{P_{c r}=\\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{(K L)^2}}\n\\tag{15.3}\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sigma_{c r}=\\frac{\\pi^2 E}{\\left(\\frac{K L}{r}\\right)^2}}\n\\tag{15.4}\\]\nYou can find the effective length factor, K, below each of the end conditions in Figure 15.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.9: Effective length of columns for various end conditions.\n\n\n\nExample 15.2 and Example 15.3 demonstrate how to calculate the critical buckling load in columns with various different supports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 15.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 15.2  \n\n\nRedo Example 15.1 with a fixed-fixed column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will consult the table in Appendix A to get the section properties of a W10x30 section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& A=8.84{~in.}^2 \\\\\n& I_x=170{~in.}^4 \\\\\n& r_y=4.38{~in.} \\\\\n& I_y=16.7{~in.}^4 \\\\\n& r_y=1.37{~in.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe will start with calculating the critical load using Euler’s Bucking Formula. Note that we can confidently say that this column will buckle about the y-axis since the moment of inertia in the y-direction is the smallest.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P_{cr}=\\frac{\\pi^2 E I^2}{(k L)^2}=\\frac{\\pi^2(29000{~ksi})(16.7{~in.^4})}{\\left(2*8{~ft}*12~\\frac{in.}{ft}\\right)^2} \\\\\n& P_{c r}=129.7{~kips} \\\\\n&\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis represents the load at which any increase in applied load will cause the column to buckle. We will calculate the stress associated with this critical load.\n\\[\n\\sigma_{c r}=\\frac{P_{cr}}{A}=\\frac{129.7{~kips}}{8.84{~in.^2}}=14.7{~ksi}\n\\]\nSince this stress is smaller than the yield stress of the steel (σy = 50 ksi) the column will buckle first at a critical load of 129.7 kips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 15.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 15.3  \n\n\nA W12x50 column carries a load of 650 kips. If the column is 25 feet long, has fixed-pinned end conditions, is braced at the midpoint in the weak direction, and is made from A492 steel (σy = 50 ksi and E = 29,000 ksi), is it adequate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& A=14.6{~in.}^2 \\\\\n& I_x=391{~in.}^4 \\\\\n& r_y=5.18{~in.} \\\\\n& I_y=56.3{~in.}^4 \\\\\n& r_y=1.96{~in.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will consult the table in Appendix A to get the section properties of a W12x50 section. We will start with calculating the critical load using Euler’s Bucking Formula. The brace at the midpoint of the column changes the length of the column in the weak direction. This doesn’t make it obvious which axis the column will buckle about so we will need to check both the strong and weak directions.\nStrong axis\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P_{cr}=\\frac{\\pi^2 E I^2}{(k L)^2}=\\frac{\\pi^2(29000{~ksi})(391{~in.}^4)}{\\left(0.7*25{~ft}*~12~\\frac{in.}{ft}\\right)^2} \\\\\n& P_{c r}=2,538{~kips} \\\\\n&\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe use the general form of Euler’s bucking equation. Since the end supports are pinned-fixed, we use K = 0.7. We calculated that the critical load in the strong direction to be 2,538 kips.\nWe will compare this to buckling about the weak axis. The values of I, K, and L will change. The L value changes because the column is braced at the midpoint, so the column has a shorter distance to buckle about. The K value can be tricky. There were no details about the brace; we don’t know if the brace will provide an end condition like a fixed or pinned end. So, we will calculate the worst case, which would be a pinned-pinned end condition (this makes the denominator the largest, so the result will be the smallest).\nWeak axis\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P_{cr}=\\frac{\\pi^2 E I^2}{(k L)^2}=\\frac{\\pi^2(29000{~ksi})(56.3{~in.^4})}{\\left(1*12.5{~ft}*12\\frac{in.}{ft}\\right)^2} \\\\\n& P_{c r}=716{~kips} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe calculated that the critical load in the weak direction to be 716 kips. This means that if the column were to buckle, it would be about the weak axis since this load was smaller. Since the critical buckling load is greater than the 650 kip applied load our column is adequate. However, we also need to calculate the load that would cause yielding of the steel.\nYield\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma_{yield}=\\frac{P}{4} \\quad\\rightarrow\\quad &P=(50{~ksi})(14.6{~in.^2}) \\\\\n& P_{yield}=730{~kips}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe calculated a yielding load of 730 kips. Interpreting these results: The column is adequate for a 650 kip load. Failure would first occur by bucking in the weak direction if the load were increased to 716 kips. It should be noted that we did not apply any safety factors. In civil engineering, design codes for steel columns designate how to apply safety factors to the loading and the capacity.\nWhat would happen to the capacity of the columns if the brace was not there? We will recalculate the critical load for bucking bout the weak direction.\nNo brace\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& P_{cr}=\\frac{\\pi^2 E I^2}{(k L)^2}=\\frac{\\pi^2(29000{~ksi})(56.3{in.^4})}{\\left(0.7*25{~ft}*12~\\frac{in.}{ft}\\right)^2} \\\\\n& P_{c r}=365{~kips} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNotice how much lower this was than the braced condition. If the column was not braced it would not be adequate for the applied load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Buckling of columns with different supports\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the geometric properties of the cross-section, including A, Ix, and Iy\nDetermine the effective length of the column, based on the supports\nApply Euler’s formula to calculate the critical buckling load.
