## Introduction

Pressure vessels are storage tanks that are used for storing fluids at high pressure and they must be designed to resist this pressure. They are commonly found in factories, power plants, vehicles, and even your own home. Figure 13.1 shows some common applications.

![Figure 13.1: Some common examples of pressure vessels. (A) standard home water heater; (B) industrial compressed gas storage; (C) propellant tank for aerospace applications; (D) butane tank for home use.](images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.1.png){fig-align="center" width="502"}

Pressure vessels are necessarily hollow, and a thin-walled pressure vessel is one where the ratio:

$$
\frac{\text { Inner radius }}{\text { W all thickness }}>10
$$

This implies that the wall thickness is relatively small compared to the vessel radius. This simplifies our analysis in two ways:

1.  We can assume that stresses in the vessel walls are uniform across the thickness of the wall
2.  We can ignore stress in the radial direction (perpendicular to the vessel wall)

As we’ll see in this chapter, stresses are generated in the walls of thin-walled pressure vessels in two directions known as the axial stress and hoop stress (figure 13.2). There is a 3^rd^ stress in the radial direction but this is very small compared to the other stresses and is assumed to be zero in this text.

![Figure 13.2: A stress element on the wall of a thin-walled pressure vessel. Stresses exist in the axial and hoop directions. The radial stress is very small in comparison and is assumed to be zero.](images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.2.png){fig-align="center" width="505"}

As seen in figure 13.1, thin-walled pressure vessels are commonly either cylindrical or spherical. Section 13.1 will discuss the stresses in cylindrical vessels. Section 13.2 will discuss the stresses in spherical vessels.

## Cylindrical Pressure Vessels

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

The equations stresses in the wall of a cylindrical pressure vessel can be derived with the help of a free body diagram. Let’s cut a cross-section through our vessel to expose the fluid inside (figure 13.3).

![Figure 13.3: Cross-section through the cylindrical vessel showing the axial stress in the walls (𝜎𝐴) and the fluid pressure P.](images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.3.png){fig-align="center" width="598"}

There will be an axial stress from the internal fluid pressure (P) and an axial stress in the walls of the vessel (𝜎~𝐴~). Since $\text{stress}=\frac{\text { force }}{\text { area }}$ we can determine the two forces. The fluid pressure acts over a circular area $A=\pi r_i^2$. The stress in the walls acts over an area equal to the circumference of the vessel multiplied by the wall thickness, $A=2 \pi r_i t$.

By equilibrium:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sum F_x=0 \\
& \left(\sigma_A\right)\left(2 \pi r_i t\right)-(P)\left(\pi r_i^2\right)=0 \\
& \sigma_A=\frac{P r_i}{2 t}
\end{aligned}
$$

where

-   𝜎~𝐴~ = Axial stress in the wall of the vessel \[Pa, psi\]

-   P = Fluid pressure inside the vessel \[Pa, psi\]

-   *r~i~* = Inner radius of the vessel \[m, in\]

-   t = Wall thickness of the vessel \[m, in\]

Similarly there will be a stress in the lateral direction, referred to as the hoop stress 𝜎~H~. Let’s cut a vertical cross-section (figure 13.4) to derive an equation for this stress.

![Figure 13.4: Cross-section through the cylindrical vessel showing the hoop stress in the walls (𝜎~H~) and the fluid pressure P.](images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.4.png){fig-align="center" width="509"}

There will again be a stress from the internal fluid pressure (P) and a stress in the walls of the vessel (𝜎~H~). The fluid pressure acts over an area of $A=2 r_i L$. The stress in the walls acts over an area of $A=2 t L$.

By equilibrium:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sum F_x=0 \\
\left(\sigma_H\right)(2 t L)-(P)\left(2 r_i L\right)=0 \\
\sigma_H=\frac{P r_i}{t}
\end{gathered}
$$

where

-   𝜎~H~ = Hoop stress in the wall of the vessel \[Pa, psi\]

-   P = Fluid pressure inside the vessel \[Pa, psi\]

-   *r~i~* = Inner radius of the vessel \[m, in\]

-   t = Wall thickness of the vessel \[m, in\]

The internal pressure P is typically reported as the gage pressure, which is defined as the internal pressure minus the atmospheric pressure. This allows us to calculate the stresses directly without needing to account for atmospheric pressure.

Since the radial stress is assumed to be zero, the axial and hoop stresses represent a state of plane stress such as those discussed in chapter 12. Further, since there is no shear stress, the axial and hoop stresses represent the principal stresses. Since the hoop stress is larger, this is the first principal stress (𝜎~1~). The axial stress is the second principal stress (𝜎~2~). The third principal stress acts in the radial direction and has already been assumed to be zero. Figure 13.5 shows a plane stress element representing the stresses in the wall of a cylindrical thin-walled pressure vessel.

![Figure 13.5: The hoop stress represents the first principal stress 𝜎~1~. The axial stress represents the second principal stress 𝜎~2~. There is no shear stress.](images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.5.png){fig-align="center" width="497"}

By the methods of chapter 12 we may perform stress transformation on these stresses. Figure 13.6 shows Mohr’s Circle for the in-plane and out-of-plane stresses.

![Figure 13.6: Mohr’s Circle for the stresses in the walls of a cylindrical thin-walled pressure vessel, showing principal stresses 𝜎~1~ and 𝜎~2~. The 3rd principal stress 𝜎~3~ = 0.](images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.6.png){fig-align="center" width="403"}

Since the two principal stresses are positive and the third principal stress is zero it should be apparent that the maximum in plane shear stress can be determined as:

$$
\tau_{\text {max } \text { in-plane }}=\frac{\sigma_1-\sigma_2}{2}
$$

It should also be apparent that the maximum out-of-plane shear stress will be larger and can be calculated from:

$$
\tau_{\max a b s}=\frac{\sigma_1}{2}
$$

Example 13.1 demonstrates calculation of the principal stresses and maximum in-plane shear stress for a cylindrical thin-walled pressure vessel. Example 13.2 combine the content from this section with stress transformation from chapter 12 in order to find the stresses at specific orientations.

## Example 13.1: Needs title

A cylindrical pressure vessel has an outer diameter of 8 ft and a wall thickness of 2 inches. The vessel contains propane at a gage pressure of 250 psi. Determine the principal stresses and maximum in-plane shear stress in the walls of the vessel.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Solution

First determine the inner radius of the vessel. It will be easiest to convert this to inches since the other length units in the problem are given in inches.

Outer radius, *r~o~* = 8 *ft*/2 = 4 *ft* = 48 *in*

Inner radius, *r~i~* = 48 - 2 = 46 *in*

Now calculate the axial and hoop stresses.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_A=\frac{P r_i}{2 t}=\frac{250 * 46}{2 * 2}=2,875 \mathrm{psi} \\
& \sigma_H=\frac{P r_i}{t}=\frac{250 * 46}{2}=5,750 \mathrm{psi}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since there is no shear stress, these are the principal stresses.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_1=5,750 p s i \\
& \sigma_2=2,875 p s i
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, the maximum in-plane shear stress can be found from:

$$
\tau_{\max \text { in plane }}=\frac{\sigma_1-\sigma_2}{2}=\frac{5,750-2,875}{2}=1,438 \mathrm{psi}
$$

## Example 13.2: Needs title

A cylindrical pressure vessel is made by welding steel plate at an angle of 𝜃=25° as shown. The vessel has an outer diameter of 1.5 m and a wall thickness of 40 mm. The vessel contains fluid at a gage pressure of 5 MPa. Determine the normal stress perpendicular to the weld and the shear stress parallel to the weld.

![](images/CH13 PNGs/example 13.2 part 1.png){fig-align="center" width="321"}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Solution

First determine the inner radius of the vessel. Wall thickness 𝑡 = 40 𝑚𝑚 = 0.04 𝑚.

Outer radius, *r~o~* = 1.5/2 = 0.75 𝑚

Inner radius, *r~i~* = 0.75 - 0.04 = 0.71 𝑚

Now calculate the axial and hoop stresses.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_A=\frac{P r_i}{2 t}=\frac{5 * 0.71}{2 * 0.04}=44.4 \mathrm{MPa} \\
& \sigma_H=\frac{P r_i}{t}=\frac{5 * 0.71}{0.04}=88.8 \mathrm{MPa}
\end{aligned}
$$

By the methods of section 12.1, we can calculate the normal stress perpendicular to the weld. Draw a stress element of a point on the pressure vessel. The axial stress will act horizontally and the hoop stress vertically for this element.

![](images/CH13 PNGs/example 13.2 part 2.png){fig-align="center" width="313"}

The weld is at an angle of 25° measured counter-clockwise from horizontal. The normal stress perpendicular to this weld is therefore at an angle of 65° clockwise from horizontal. We can determine the normal stress at this orientation from:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sigma_x^{\prime}=\frac{\sigma_x+\sigma_y}{2}+\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2} \cos (2 \theta)+\tau_{x y} \sin (2 \theta) \\
\sigma_x^{\prime}=\frac{44.4+88.8}{2}+\frac{44.4-88.8}{2} \cos \left(2 *-65^{\circ}\right)+0 \\
\sigma_x^{\prime}=66.6-22.2 \cos \left(-130^{\circ}\right) \\
\sigma_x^{\prime}=80.9 \mathrm{MPa}
\end{gathered}
$$

The shear stress occurs parallel to the weld at an angle of 25° counter-clockwise from the horizontal. We can determine the shear stress at this orientation from:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\tau_{x^{\prime} y^{\prime}}=-\left(\frac{\sigma_x-\sigma_y}{2}\right) \sin (2 \theta)+\tau_{x y} \cos (2 \theta) \\
\tau_{x^{\prime} y^{\prime}}=-\left(\frac{44.4-88.8}{2}\right) \sin \left(2 * 25^{\circ}\right)+0 \\
\tau_{x^{\prime} y^{\prime}}=-\left(\frac{44.4-88.8}{2}\right) \sin \left(2 * 25^{\circ}\right)+0 \\
\tau_{x^{\prime} y^{\prime}}=22.2 \sin \left(50^{\circ}\right) \\
\tau_{x^{\prime} y^{\prime}}=17.0 \mathrm{MPa}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Spherical Pressure Vessels

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

A spherical vessel will yield the same cross-section regardless of the axis it is cut along (figure 13.7). The stress in the walls of a spherical vessel is the same as the axial stress in a cylindrical vessel.

By equilibrium:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sum F_x=0 \\
\left(\sigma_A\right)\left(2 \pi r_i t\right)-(P)\left(\pi r_i^2\right)=0 \\
\sigma_A=\frac{P r_i}{2 t}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Figure 13.7: Cross-section through the spherical vessel showing the axial stress in the walls (𝜎~A~) and the fluid pressure P.](images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.7.png){fig-align="center" width="274"}

In this case, the same stress exists in both principal directions. We will again assume that the radial stress is zero, meaning that these stresses again form a state of plane stress (figure 13.8). There is again no shear stress, so these stresses are the principal stresses. In this case, the two principal stresses are the same.

![Figure 13.8: Spherical vessels experience the same axial stress in both principal directions. There is no shear stress.](images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.8.png){fig-align="center" width="246"}

Note that these principal stresses are equal to 𝜎~2~ in the cylindrical vessel. As such, spherical vessels are stronger than cylindrical vessels. However, they are also more expensive to manufacture so cylindrical vessels are still very common.

We may again use the methods of chapter 12 to perform stress transformation. Figure 13.9 shows Mohr’s Circle for the in-plane and out-of-plane stresses.

![Figure 13.9: Mohr’s Circle for the stresses in the walls of a spherical thin-walled pressure vessel. Principal stresses 𝜎~1~ = 𝜎~2~ and the in-plane circle reduces to a single point. The 3rd principal stress 𝜎~3~ = 0.](images/CH13 PNGs/figure 13.9.png){fig-align="center" width="418"}

This time 𝜎~1~ = 𝜎~2~ and so the in-plane Mohr’s Circle reduces to a single point. The maximum in-plane shear stress is therefore zero. The maximum out-of-plane shear stress can be calculated from:

$$
\tau_{\max a b s}=\frac{\sigma_1}{2}
$$

Example 13.3 demonstrates the design of a spherical vessel, based on the allowable stress in the vessel walls.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Example 13.3: Needs title

A spherical pressure vessel is made of steel with a yield strength of 250 MPa. The vessel has an outer diameter of 4 meters and a wall thickness of 25 mm. If the factor of safety with respect to yield is 2.5, determine the maximum allowable gage pressure of the fluid within the vessel.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Solution

Wall thickness, 𝑡 = 25 𝑚𝑚 = 0.025 𝑚

Outer radius, *r~o~* = 2 𝑚

Inner radius, *r~i~* = 2 - 0.025 = 1.975 𝑚

Start by using the factor of safety to find the maximum allowable stress in the walls of the vessel.

$$
\sigma_{\text {allow }}=\frac{250}{2.5}=100 \text{ Mpa}
$$

Spherical vessels experience the same stress in both directions:

$$
\sigma_A=\frac{P r_i}{2 t}
$$

Rearrange this equation to solve for P:

$$
\begin{gathered}
P=\frac{\sigma_A * 2 t}{r_i} \\
P=\frac{100 * 2 * 0.025}{1.975}=2.53 \text{ MPa}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Key takeaways

Pressure vessels contain fluids at high pressure. A thin walled pressure vessel is one where $\frac{\text { Inner radius }}{\text { Wall thickness }}>10$.

For thin walled pressure vessels, the stresses in the vessel walls are assumed to be constant across the thickness of the wall and the stress in the radial direction is assumed to be zero. The stresses created in the axial and hoop directions by the fluid pressure are the principal stresses.

Pressure vessels are commonly cylindrical or spherical. Cylindrical vessels experience both axial and hoop stresses. The axial stress is half of the hoop stress. Spherical vessels experience only an axial stress. As such, spherical vessels experience less stress than cylindrical vessels.

There is no shear stress generated in the axial and hoop directions. However, stress transformation can be used to determine both in-plane and out-of-plane shear stresses.
