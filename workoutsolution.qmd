## Worked Out Solution

This demonstrates a worked out solution to the problem. The best way to begin is by drawing a free body diagram.

![Figure 3: Three traffic light installation with loads](images/FBD%20sample%20problem.png){fig-alt="Picture with three distinct traffic lights oriented along the same horizontal beam. Moving from left to right of the image, the first light A is at the end of the beam, the second light B is 4 ft from A, the third light C is 4 ft from light B, and light C is 7 ft from where the horizontal beam meets the vertical post (called post O). The free body diagram includes a downforce force acting on light A with a value of 65 pounds, a downward force acting on light B with a value of 50 points, a downward force acting on light C with a value of 50 pounds, and a reaction Moment M and Force N at the post at O."}

Use equilibrium equations to find the internal loads:

$$
\Sigma F_y=0: N-65-50-50=0\\
$$
$$N=165~lbs
$$

$$
\Sigma M_O=0: -M+(50\times7)+(50\times11)+(65\times15)=0
\\$$
$$
M=1875~lb\cdot ft=22500~lb\cdot in
$$

Now, determine the cross-sectional properties:

$$
A=\pi(r_0^2-r_i^2)=\pi(2.5^2-2.3^2)=3.02~in^2
\\
I=
\frac{\pi}{4}
(r_0^4-r_i^4)=\frac{\pi}{4}(2.5^4-2.3^4)=8.70~in^4
$$

Calculate stress due to normal force:

$$
\sigma_n=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{-165~lbs}{3.02~in^2}=-54.7~psi
$$

Calculate maximum stress due to bending moment (will have same magnitude in both tension and compression):

$$
\sigma_m=\pm\frac{M_c}{I}=\pm\frac{22500\times2.5}{8.70}=\pm6460~psi
$$

Determine combined tensile stress: $\sigma_T=-54.7+6460=6410~psi$

Determine combined compressive stress: $\sigma_T=-54.7-6460=-6520~psi$
