    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nMechanics can be broadly categorized in three parts, of which this text covers one. Statics explores the effects of external loads applied to rigid bodies in equilibrium. Dynamics explores the effects of external loads applied to rigid bodies that are not in equilibrium. In Mechanics of Deformable Bodies, the subject of this text, we explore the effects of both external and internal loads on non-rigid bodies in equilibrium.\nSince bodies in this text are in equilibrium, many of the principles from statics still apply. However, because these bodies are non-rigid, a much deeper analysis is required. Objects in this text will deform. When loads are applied, they will change their shapes. They will elongate and bend and twist and, if we’re not careful, may even break. Real objects are deformable, and engineers must take great care to ensure that their designs do not break or deform so much that they are unfit for purpose.\nHave you ever wondered why civil engineers tend to use certain materials for bridges and buildings, while automotive engineers use an entirely different set of materials in cars? Meanwhile, aerospace engineers don’t make rockets out of the same materials that biomedical engineers use for prosthetics. There are many material properties that determine applications that a given material may, or may not, be suitable for. Two fundamental concepts explored in this text are stress, which helps us determine whether an object will break under a given load, and strain, which relates to the object’s deformation.\nThis text begins with an overview of stress and strain. Depending on how external loads are applied, there are a variety of potential internal loads on our object. You are likely already familiar with these loads and their effects, even if you haven’t explicitly though about them.\n\nAxial forces push or pull on a body. They cause elongation and compression. For example, imagine pulling on the ends of an elastic band. The band will stretch significantly. Objectd may be pulled apart or crushed by this load. Imagine doing the same with a piece of chalk. There will be a small amount of deformation and the chalk will break.\nBending moments act to bend an object. Imagine propping a long piece of plywood up on two supports and standing in the middle. The wood will bend. If you jump and land hard enough, it may even break.\nShear forces are created when one body (or part of a body) slides relative to another. They commonly occur in conjunction with bending moments.\nTorsional moments act to twist an object. Imagine holding the ends of a cable and rotating your wrists so that the cable twists around itself along its length. You will see the cable rotate through ever larger angles. Twist it too far and it will break.\n\nThis text will explore the effects of these loads and expand your understanding of these effects. It aims to describe these effects in a conceptual way, building on your existing understanding. Once these effects are understood conceptually, we’ll learn how to calculate the exact amount of deformation and the exact size of the stress created. We’ll learn to make sure that our designs stay within appropriate limits. There will necessarily be a significant amount of math involved in these calculations but it is just as important, if not more so, that we understand the principles behind those calculations. As such, this text leads with conceptual descriptions and realistic examples before working numerical problems.\nThe stress and strain resulting from these four types of load account for the majority of this text. Once they are thoroughly understood, more advanced topics necessary for a thorough understanding of these fundamental concepts are included. Upon completion of a course using this text, students will be able to explain the stress and strain observed under different types of load, calculate the amount of stress and strain, and design individual components to be within acceptable limits for both. Students will be prepared for advanced courses in a variety of engineering disciplines, and will be able to apply their knowledge to realistic scenarios."

    "title": "11  Beam Deflection",
    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nWe now know how to calculate both the bending stress (Chapter 9) and shear stress (Chapter 10) in a beam. In this chapter we’ll consider the deformation of a beam subjected to bending and shear stresses. Under load, beams deflect from their original position (Figure 11.1). Some amount of deflection is unavoidable, but it is usually desirable to limit deflection as much as possible. Although deflection often doesn’t pose a safety risk (unless the allowable stress of the beam is also exceeded) too much deflection can render a beam unfit for purpose.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: A model bridge showing severe deflection along its span (left). Although the bridge hasn’t broken, there is too much deflection for the application. The deflection in a hockey stick during a shot (right). In this application the deflection is helpful as it stores and releases energy during the shot.\n\n\nIdealized sketches showing the shape of the deflected beam are a helpful visual aid. This deflected shape is known as the elastic curve (Figure 11.2). Sketches of the elastic curve provide a quick visual reference of how the beam will deflect and can be used to check that our numerical answers are realistic.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Two example beams showing the undeflected position of the centerline (dotted line) and the deflected position of the elastic curve (solid line).\n\n\nIn section 5.3 we learned to calculate deformation due to axial load \\(\\left(\\Delta L=\\frac{F L}{A E}\\right)\\). In section 6.2 we learned to calculate deformation due to torsional load \\(\\left(\\varnothing=\\frac{T L}{J G}\\right)\\). Note that both types of deformation depend on:\n\nApplied/internal load (F, T)\nLength of the object (L)\nCross-section geometry (A, J)\nMaterial properties (E, G)\n\nIt is probably not surprising then that beam deflection also depends on these four things. We’ll study two common techniques for calculating deflection: The method of integration (sections 11.1 and 11.2) and the method of superposition (section 11.3). Being able to calculate deflection is vitally important, as it allows us to predict how much a beam will deflect before we build a structure. Once we’re able to calculate deflection, we’ll use this to help solve some more statically indeterminate problems (Section 11.4). Finally, we’ll build on our beam design work of section 9.2 by expanding our specifications to include limitations on not just bending stress, but shear stress and deflection as well."

    "section": "11.1 Integration of the Moment Equation",
    "text": "11.1 Integration of the Moment Equation\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nWe’ll begin by deriving an equation for calculating the deflection at any point in a loaded beam. In Chapter 9, we derived two equations relating to bending stress.\n\\[\n\\sigma=-\\frac{E y}{\\rho}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma=-\\frac{M y}{I}\n\\]\nSet these equations equal:\n\\[\n\\frac{E y}{\\rho}=\\frac{M y}{I}\n\\]\nRearrange:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\rho}=\\frac{M(x)}{E I}\n\\]\nThe radius of curvature (ρ) can be related to the deflection (y) by the equation\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\rho}=\\frac{\\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}}}{\\left[1+\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)^{2}\\right]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\n\\]\nThis equation describes the exact deflection \\((y)\\) at any distance \\((x)\\) along the beam. In most engineering applications the deflection \\((y)\\) is very small. We can simplify this equation significantly by assuming that our deflection \\((y)\\) will be small and thus that \\(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\) is very small and \\(\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}\\) is negligible. This simplifies the equation to\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\rho}=\\frac{\\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}}}{[1+0]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}=\\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}}\n\\]\nFinally\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\rho}=\\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}}=\\frac{M(x)}{E I}\n\\]\nTo solve for deflection we can first find an equation for the internal bending moment as a function of \\((x)\\), using equilibrium just as we did in section 7.2 for drawing the bending moment diagram. We can then set this equation equal to \\(E I \\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}\\) and integrate twice.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nM(x)=E I \\frac{\\partial^{2} y}{\\partial x^{2}} \\\\\n\\int M(x) d x+C 1=E I \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\\\\n\\iint M(x) d x+C 1 x+C 2=E I y\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nIn these equations, \\(y\\) represents the deflection of the beam and \\(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\) represents the slope of the deflected beam. Since the equations are functions of \\(x\\), we can find the slope and deflection at any point along the beam.\nNote that each successive integral introduces a constant of integration which we must solve for. We do this through the use of boundary conditions—that is, points on the beam where we already know the slope and/or deflection. The most common boundary conditions for our applications will be:\n\nAt any support the deflection \\((y)\\) is zero\nAt a fixed support the slope \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)\\) is zero\n\nFigure 11.3 illustrates these boundary conditions. Once the constants of integration are known, we can define equations for the slope and deflection of the beam in terms of distance \\((x)\\) along the beam and calculate the slope and deflection at any value of \\(x\\). See Example 11.1 and Example 11.2 to see this process applied to a simply supported beam and a cantilever beam respectively.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: At pin and roller supports, the deflection is zero but the slope is not. At a fixed support, both the slope and deflection are zero. For a statically determinate beam in equilibrium we will always have two boundary conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.1\n\n\n\n\n\nA simply supported beam of length L = 10 m is subjected to a uniform distributed load of w = 20 kN/m.

Remember to convert feet to inches in both the distributed load and the length:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} & y=\\frac{1}{29 \\times 10^6 \\times 375} \\left[-\\frac{\\frac{30000}{12} \\times (8\\times12)^4}{30}\\right] \\\\ & y=- 0.651 \\mathrm{~in.}\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer only\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\ny=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left[-\\frac{w_0 x^5}{120L}+\\frac{w_0 L^3}{24} x-\\frac{w_0 L^4}{30}\\right]\n\\]\n\\[\ny=-0.651~in.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above examples have single continuous loads. If the loading is discontinuous we must modify our approach as there will not be one single moment equation that describes the entire beam. We saw in section 7.2 when drawing shear force & bending moment diagrams that we can find a different equation for the internal bending moment in each loading region (i.e., a piecewise function over the length of the beam). We must find separate moment equations for each loading region and integrate each separately. This must be done each time the loading changes (a discontinuity in the moment diagram), such as:\n\nBoth sides of a concentrated load\nWhenever a distributed load begins or ends\n\nSee Example 11.3 for an example of a beam with 2 loading regions. Note that in this example we will need to determine 2 internal bending moment equations and integrate each equation twice, thereby introducing four constants of integration. Two of these can still be determined by using boundary conditions, but we still need to determine the other two. This is done with continuity conditions.\nEquation set 1 describes the internal moment, slope, and deflection of the beam from point A to point B, and equation set 2 describes the internal moment, slope, and deflection from point B to point C. Note that both sets of equations describe point B, where the loading changes. They must therefore return the same results at point B. We can therefore say that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)_{1} & =\\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}\\right)_{2} \\\\\ny_{1} & =y_{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.3\n\n\n\n\n\nA simply supported beam is subjected to a distributed load of w = 20 kN/m as shown. Determine the equation of the elastic curve between 0 ≤ x ≤ 6 m and between 6 m ≤ x ≤ 9m. \nThen determine the deflection at x = 5m.

In some cases it may be easier to make one cut from the left and the other from the right. Consider the simple beam in Figure 11.4. When making a cut in the region not under the distributed load, a free body diagram to the left of the cut has many more forces than a free body diagram of the right side.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Simple beam showing two options for finding the internal bending moment. Note that the moment equation will be much simpler if we draw the right hand side of the cut.\n\n\nThe moment equation will be much simpler if we draw the right hand side of the cut. This in turn simplifies the integrations and the math involved in finding the constants of integration. We must however make one change to our continuity conditions if we measure distance x2 from the right. When making both cuts from the left we said that at point C the slope and deflection from calculated from equation 1 must be the same as those calculated from equation 2.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)_{1} & =\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)_{2} \\\\\ny_{1} & =y_{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhen measuring distance x2 from the right, it is still true at point C that [math] as the deflection is still downwards regardless of whether we measure our horizontal distance from the left or right. The magnitude of the slope will also be the same at point C regardless of which equation we use to calculate it. However, the direction of rotation of the slope will change from counter-clockwise to clockwise due to us changing the coordinate system (Figure 11.5). Thus our second boundary condition must become\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)_{1}=-\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)_{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Depending on which side of the cut we draw, the deflection at point C will have the same magnitude and direction. The slope at point C will have the same magnitude but opposite directions if we make one cut from the left and the other from the right.\n\n\nThis negative sign is vitally important, and we will not get the correct answer if we forget to include it. Example 11.3 has been reworked below, this time with one cut made from the right hand side instead. Compare to the previous solution to see the differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.3 (reworked)\n\n\n\n\n\nA simply supported beam is subjected to a distributed load of w = 20 kN/m as shown.

For some loading configurations it can be much simpler to integrate the distributed load equation 4 times instead of finding the equation of the internal bending moment through equilibrium and integrating twice. When doing this, remember that loads acting downwards (as most loads on beams do) are negative.\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nw(x)=E I \\frac{d^{4} y}{d x^{4}} \\\\\nV(x)=E I \\frac{d^{3} y}{d x^{3}}=\\int w(x) d x+C 1 \\\\\nM(x)=E I \\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}=\\int V(x) d x+C 2 \\\\\n\\theta(x)=E I \\frac{d y}{d x}=\\int M(x) d x+C 3 \\\\\ny(x)=\\int \\theta(x) d x+C 4\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nNote that each successive integral will introduce a new constant of integration.

Two of these are the same as in section 11.1:\n\nAt any support the deflection is 0\nAt a fixed support, both the slope and deflection are zero\n\nThe other two boundary conditions come from knowing the value of the shear force and bending moment at a point in the beam. We are able to find these from our work in chapter 7. While we can use known values at any point in the beam, it is generally easiest to use the shear force and bending moment at x = 0. At this point:\n\nThe shear force will be equal to the applied force (including a force applied by a support) if there is one, or zero otherwise.\nThe bending moment will be equal to the applied moment (including a moment applied by a fixed support) if there is one, or zero otherwise.\n\nSee Example 11.4 for a demonstration of how to find the deflection of a beam by integrating the load equation. Note that while this method can be used for any beam, it is best applied to beams with a single continuous distributed load acting over the length of the beam.

In such cases, the method of superposition is a good alternative.\nBeams are typically loaded in a relatively small number of standard configurations, and the deflection behavior of a beam subjected to one of these standard loads is very well understood. A subset of beam deflections have been included in Appendix C. Figure 11.6 shows an example of the information provided for one such beam.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: Appendix C contains some standard loading configurations along with a sketch of the elastic curve, equations for the maximum deflection and maximum slope, and the general equation of the elastic curve.\n\n\nThis can be useful even for more complex loading. When multiple loads act on a beam, the effect of each load on the deflection of the beam may be considered independently. Thus, even for loading more complex than the loads in Appendix C, it may be possible to simplify the problem by considering each load separately and calculating the deflection caused at a point by each load (Figure 11.7). These deflections can then be added together to find the overall deflection at that point. We must of course calculate the deflection at the same point for each load in order to add them together. See Example 11.5 for a demonstration.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: Although Appendix C doesn’t contain a cantilever beam with both a distributed load and a concentrated load, it does contain cantilever beams with each load separately.

We have seen statically indeterminate problems in section 5.5 and section 6.4. In both sections we used a similar method to solve statically indeterminate problems where we took advantage of our knowledge of deformation in order to solve for one of the reaction forces before using equilibrium equations to find the others. We’ll do something similar here. We may use either an integration method similar to that of section 11.1 or a superposition method similar to that of section 11.3.\nIn practice, engineers design structures with redundancies so that if one part fails it can be replaced without the entire structure collapsing. As such, static indeterminacy is the norm.\nIn section 11.1 we cut a cross-section and found the internal bending moment as a function of x, M = f(x). We integrated this twice to determine the equation of the elastic curve. For statically indeterminate problems, we will write our moment equation as a function of both x and A, where A is the unknown force at the redundant support. After integrating this equation twice we will have three unknowns, but also three boundary conditions.

While it can be used for more complex loads, it quickly becomes complicated and time consuming. For these problems it is generally better to use superposition.\nThe method is very similar to the methods used to solve other statically indeterminate problems in section 5.5 and section 6.4. To solve a statically indeterminate deflection problem using superposition, first identify the redundant support. We have 3 equilibrium equations and so can solve for three unknown support reactions. Any support reactions beyond this are redundant. Remove the redundant reaction and determine the deflection due to the applied loads at the point that the reaction was removed. It is best to remove a support such that the remaining beam is either simply supported or cantilever as these are the only support configuration in Appendix C.\nThen replace the redundant reaction and determine the deflection due to this reaction and the point that the reaction is applied. Since there is actually a support here, the total deflection must be zero. Sum both deflections and set them equal to zero. This will allow you to calculate the value of the redundant support. Once this is known the other reaction loads can be determined using equilibrium. See Example 11.7 for a demonstration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.7\n\n\n\n\n\nThe propped cantilever beam of Example 11.6 is shown again here. If length L = 6 ft is subjected to a linear distributed load where w0 = 20 kips/ft. Determine the reactions at supports A and B. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated in Example 11.6, this problem is statically indeterminate.\nThis time, let’s remove redundant support Ay and use Appendix C to find the deflection at point A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\ny_{A_1}=-\\frac{w_0 L^4}{30 E I}\n\\]\nNow replace Ay and use Appendix C to find the deflection at point A caused by Ay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\ny_{A_2}=\\frac{A_{y L}{ }^3}{3 E I}\n\\]\nSince there is actually a support at A, the deflection at A must be zero.\n\\[\n-\\frac{w_0 L^4}{30 E I}+\\frac{A_y L^3}{3EI}=0 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad A_y=\\frac{W_0 L}{10}\n\\]\nThis is the same answer we found in Example 11.6, and the rest of the problem proceeds in the same way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer only\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}&A_y=12~\\text{kips}\\\\&B_y=48~\\text{kips}\\\\&M_B=48~\\text{kip·ft}\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to remove a moment reaction in order to leave a simply supported beam. In this case, determining the deflection at the point that the load was removed isn’t helpful as removing the moment reaction from a fixed support effectively leaves a pin support and the deflection with the moment removed will still be zero. In this situation we can instead look at the slope at the point that the reaction was removed. Example 11.7 is repeated below with the moment at B removed instead of the force at A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.7 (reworked)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe propped cantilever beam of Example 11.6 is shown again here.

Instead, use Appendix C to find the slope at B.\n\\[\n\\theta_B=\\frac{W_0 L^3}{45 E I}\n\\]\nNow replace the moment reaction at B and use Appendix C to find the slope at B due to this moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\theta_B=-\\frac{M_B L}{3 E I}\n\\]\nSince there is actually a fixed support at B, the slope here must be zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} &\\frac{W_0 L^3}{45 E I}-\\frac{M_{B L}}{3 E I}=0 \\\\ &M_B  =\\frac{W_0 L^2}{15}\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAdding numbers we get:\n\\[\nM_B=\\frac{20 \\times 6^2}{15}=48 \\text{ kip·ft}\n\\]\nWhich is the same answer we found in Example 11.6. Reactions Ay and By can be found by equilibrium and will also give the same answers as Example 11.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer only\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}&A_y=12~\\text{kips}\\\\&B_y=48~\\text{kips}\\\\&M_B=48~\\text{kip·ft}\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that some problems may involve multiple redundant reactions. In such cases, remove all redundant reactions and determine the deflection due to the external loads at every point that a reaction was removed. Then replace the redundant reactions one at a time and determine the deflection due to each load at every point that a reaction was removed. As before, the total deflection at each of these points must be zero. Sum the deflection at each point and set it equal to zero. There will be one equation for every redundant reaction and so all redundant reactions can be calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep-by-step: Statically Indeterminate Deflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify and remove redundant reaction(s).\nDetermine the deflection at the point that the reaction was removed. Use superposition if possible, or integration otherwise.\n\nIf the removed reaction was a couple, determine the slope at this point instead.\n\nReplace the redundant reaction and determine the deflection caused by this load at the point that the load acts.\n\nIf the removed reaction was a couple, determine the slope at this point instead.\n\nThese deflections (or slopes) must add up to the total deflection at this point. This is typically zero due to the support unless indicated otherwise. Use this to determine the magnitude of the redundant reaction.\nUse equilibrium to solve for the other reactions. Then solve for anything else required as normal."

    "text": "11.5 Intermediate Beam design\n\n\nClick to expand\n\nIn Section 9.2 we learned how to use the section modulus to design a beam to meet bending stress specifications. In practice, beams must also meet specifications for shear stress and deflection. Limitations will be placed on all three of these criteria and we must design our beams to meet all three simultaneously. We’ll begin with rectangular cross-sections and then move on to W beams.\nAs in section 9.2, problems involving rectangular cross-sections will typically relate the base and height of the cross-section such that we only need to determine one dimension. Previously we designed the cross-section to resist bending stress using:\n\\[\nS_{\\min }=\\frac{M_{\\max }}{\\sigma_{\\text {allow }}}=\\frac{I}{c}\n\\]\nSince \\(I=\\frac{b h^{3}}{12}\\) and \\(c=\\frac{h}{2}\\) we were able to determine the required dimensions to meet the minimum required section modulus. The equation \\(S=\\frac{I}{c}\\) will simplify to \\(S=\\frac{\\frac{b h^{3}}{12}}{\\frac{h}{2}}=\\frac{2 b h^{3}}{12 h}=\\frac{b h^{2}}{6}\\) for a rectangle.\nTo meet the minimum required shear stress we will use \\(\\tau=\\frac{V Q}{I t}\\). Using the method of section 10.1, it can be shown for a rectangle (Figure 11.8) that \\(Q=y A=\\frac{h}{4} \\frac{b h}{2}=\\frac{b h^{2}}{8}\\). Since \\(I=\\frac{b h^{3}}{12}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{t}=\\mathrm{b}\\), we can re-write the shear stress equation to find the maximum shear stress in a rectangular cross-section as \\(\\tau_{\\max }=\\frac{V \\frac{b h^{2}}{8}}{\\frac{b h^{3}}{12} b}=\\frac{12 V b h^{2}}{8 b^{2} h^{3}}=\\frac{12 V}{8 b h}=\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{V}{A}\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 11.8: Rectangular cross-section showing the dimensions used for calculating the section modulus (S) and first moment of area (Q).\n\n\nThus we may set \\(\\tau_{\\max }=\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{V}{A}\\) and solve for the required dimensions to not exceed the maximum allowable shear stress.\nThe maximum deflection of the beam under a given loading configuration can be found using the methods of this chapter. Wherever possible, use superposition and Appendix C. If it is not possible to use Appendix C then the method of integration can be used instead. In either case the equation for the maximum deflection of the beam will include the area moment of inertia, I. Set the maximum allowable deflection equal to this equation and replace \\(I=\\frac{b h^{3}}{12}\\). We can then solve for the required dimensions of the cross-section to not exceed the maximum allowable deflection of the beam.\nWe now have three different dimensions—one required to not exceed the maximum bending stress, one required to not exceed the maximum shear stress, and one required to not exceed the maximum deflection. Since we must not exceed any of these limitation, we select the largest of our three potential answers. See Example 11.8 for a demonstration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.8\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simply supported wooden beam (E = 1700 ksi) of length L = 12 ft is subjected to a uniform distributed load of w = 1.5 kips/ft. \nAssume the beam has an allowable bending stress of 900 psi, an allowable shear stress of 180 psi, and the deflection is limited to beam span / 240. \nThe beam has a rectangular cross-section where h = 1.5b. Determine the minimum required dimensions of the beam’s cross-section to meet these specifications. Give your answer rounded up to the nearest inch to allow for realistic manufacturing tolerances. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nStart by drawing shear force and bending moment diagrams to determine the maximum internal loads:\n\n\n\n\n\nVmax = 9 kips\nMmax = 27 kip·ft\nDesign for bending by using the minimum required section modulus, Smin:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} S_{\\min }=\\frac{M_{\\max }}{\\sigma_{\\text {allow}}} & =\\frac{27000 \\times 12}{900}=360 \\mathrm{~in.}^3 \\\\ 360=\\frac{b h^2}{6} & =\\frac{b(1.5b)^2}{6}=\\frac{2.25 \\mathrm{~b}^3}{6} \\\\ b & =9.805 \\mathrm{~in.}\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nDesign for shear:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} & \\tau_{\\text {max }}=\\frac{3}{2} \\frac{V}{A} \\\\ & 180=\\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{9000}{A} \\\\ & A=\\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{9000}{180}=b h=b(1.5 b)=1.5 b^2 \\\\ & b=7.071 \\mathrm{~in.}\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nDesign for deflection:\nFrom Appendix C,\n\\[\ny_{\\max }=- \\frac{5 w L^4}{384 E I}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}-\\frac{\\text { Span }}{240}=-\\frac{(12 \\times 12)}{240}=-\\frac{5 \\times \\frac{1500}{12} \\times(12 \\times 12)^4}{384 \\times 1700000 \\times I} \\\\ I=\\frac{bh^3}{12}=\\frac{b(1.5b)^3}{12}=\\frac{3.375b^4}{12}=\\frac{5 \\times \\frac{1500}{12}+(12 \\times 12)^4}{384 \\times 1700000} \\times \\frac{240}{12 \\times 12} \\\\ b=7.028 \\mathrm{~in.}\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nWe must select the largest dimension in order to meet all these criteria\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} & b_{\\text {req }}=9.865 \\mathrm{~in.} \\\\ & h_{\\text {req }}=14.8 \\mathrm{~in.}\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo the next nearest inch:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} & b_{\\text {req }}=10 \\mathrm{~in.} \\\\ & h_{\\text req }=15 \\mathrm{~in.}\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer only\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} & b_{\\text {req }}=10 \\mathrm{~in.} \\\\ & h_{\\text req }=15 \\mathrm{~in.}\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor W beams we can again use the method of section 9.2 to select a beam from Appendix A that meets the specifications for bending stress. Use \\(S_{\\min }=\\frac{M_{\\max }}{\\sigma_{\\text {allow }}}\\) and select a beam with \\(\\mathrm{S}&gt;\\mathrm{S}_{\\min }\\).\nNext determine the equation for the maximum deflection of the beam under the given loading conditions. As before, use superposition and Appendix C whenever possible. Set the maximum allowable deflection equal to this equation and solve for the minimum required area moment of inertia, \\(I_{\\min }\\). Now select the lightest beam from Appendix A that meets both \\(S_{\\min }\\) and \\(I_{\\min }\\).\nSteel W beams rarely fail due to shear stress, but shear must still be checked. An exact value for the maximum shear stress in the beam can be found from \\(\\tau_{\\max }=\\frac{V Q}{I t}\\). However, most of the shear stress is resisted by the web of the beam. A reasonable estimate of the maximum shear stress can be found using \\(\\tau_{\\text {estimate }}=\\frac{V}{A_{w e b}}\\). This calculation is much simpler, but it is important to note that it is only an estimate. In most cases the maximum shear stress will be significantly less than the allowable shear stress and this estimate will suffice to demonstrate that. In the rare case that the maximum shear stress is within 20% of the allowable shear stress, an exact value must be determined using \\(\\tau_{\\max }=\\frac{V Q}{I t}\\). The beam was already selected to meet the bending stress and deflection requirements. As long as the maximum shear stress is less than the allowable shear stress, the beam can be used. See Example 11.9 for a demonstration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11.9\n\n\n\n\n\nA steel (E = 210 GPa) W-beam of length L = 10 m will need to support the load shown, where w = 5 kN/m and F = 100 kN. \nAssume the beam has an allowable bending stress of 150 MPa, an allowable shear stress of 100 MPa, and the maximum deflection is limited to 40 mm. \nSelect the lightest weight W-beam from Appendix A that meets these specifications. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad is symmetric, so each support will hold half the load.

From Appendix C we can see the maximum deflection for both the concentrated load and the distributed load occur in the same place. We can therefore add the two maximum deflection equations together and solve for the area moment of inertia.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} & \\begin{aligned} y_{\\text {max }} & = -0.04=-\\frac{5 w L^4}{384 E^2 I}-\\frac{F L^3}{48 E I} \\\\ I_{\\text {req }}= & \\frac{1}{0.04}\\left[\\frac{5 \\times 5000 \\times 10^4}{384 \\times 210 \\times 10^9}+\\frac{100000 \\times 10^3}{48 \\times 210 \\times 10^9}\\right] \\\\ I_{\\text {req }} & =0.0003255 \\mathrm{~m}^4 \\\\ = & 325.5 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~mm}^4\\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSelect lightest beam from Appendix A with\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned} & S&gt;2083\\times10^3 \\mathrm{~mm}^3 \\\\ & I&gt;325.5\\times10^6 \\mathrm{~mm}^4\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nOptions include:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}&W310\\times143\\quad(S=2150\\times10^3~mm^3,I=347\\times10^6~mm^4)\\\\\n&W360\\times216\\quad(S=3800\\times10^3~mm^3,I=712\\times10^6~mm^4)\\\\\n&W410\\times114\\quad(S=2200\\times10^3~mm^3,I=462\\times10^6~mm^4)\\\\\n&W460\\times113\\quad(S=2390\\times10^3~mm^3,I=554\\times10^6~mm^4)\\\\\n&W530\\times150\\quad(S=3720\\times10^3~mm^3,I=1010\\times10^6~mm^4)\\\\\n&W610\\times101\\quad(S=2520\\times10^3~mm^3,I=762\\times10^6~mm^4)\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSelect the lightest of these beams.\nUse W610 x 101.\nCheck the estimated shear stress to make sure that there’s no risk of exceeding the allowable shear stress:\n\\[\n{\\text { For }}W610\\times 101, A_{w e b}=t_w d=0.0105 \\times 0.602=0.006321 \\mathrm{~m}^2\\]\\[\\tau=\\frac{v_{\\text {max}}}{A_\\text{web}}=\\frac{75000}{0.006321}=11.9 \\mathrm{~MPa}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\tau_{Allow}=100 ~MPa\\) this will be fine.
